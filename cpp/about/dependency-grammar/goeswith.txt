This relation links two or more parts of a word that are separated in text that is not well edited. These parts should be written together as one word according to the ortographic rules of a given language. The head is always the first part, the other parts are attached to it with the goeswith relation (for consistency, similarly as in flat, fixed and conj). Note that only the last part may be annotated with SpaceAfter=No.
