dislocated: dislocated elements
@
The dislocated relation is used for fronted or postposed elements that do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a sentence. These elements often appear to be in the periphery of the sentence, and may be separated off with a comma intonation.

(example: Il faut pas la manger, la plasticine)
