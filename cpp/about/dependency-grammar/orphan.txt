orphan: orphan
@
The orphan relation is used in cases of head ellipsis where simple promotion would result in unnatural and misleading dependency relation. The typical case is predicate ellipsis where one of the core arguments have to be promoted to clausal head.

(example: Marie won gold and Peter bronze)
