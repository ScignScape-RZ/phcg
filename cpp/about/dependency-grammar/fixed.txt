fixed: fixed multiword expression
@
The fixed relation is one of the three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs) (the other two being flat and compound). It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave like function words or short adverbials.

New from v2: The fixed relation replaces the old mwe relation to prevent misunderstanding regarding its scope.

Fixed MWEs are annotated in a flat structure, where all subsequent words in the expression are attached to the first one using the fixed label. The assumption is that these expressions do not have any internal syntactic structure (except from a historical perspective) and that the structural annotation is in principle arbitrary. In practice, however, it is highly desirable to use a consistent annotation of all fixed MWEs in all languages.
