discourse: discourse element
@
This is used for interjections and other discourse particles and elements (which are not clearly linked to the structure of the sentence, except in an expressive way). We generally follow the guidelines of what the Penn Treebanks count as an INTJ. They define this to include: interjections (oh, uh-huh, Welcome), fillers (um, ah), and discourse markers (well, like, actually, but not you know).

These discourse elements are attached to the head of the most relevant nearby clause, which is why they are grouped with non-core clausal dependents even though they are normally not dependents of the predicates as such.
