nmod: nominal modifie
@
The nmod relation is used for nominal dependents of another noun or noun phrase and functionally corresponds to an attribute, or genitive complement.

In conjunction with the case relation, nmod provides a uniform analysis for the possessive alternation (with the option of a subtype like nmod:poss to distinguish non-adpositional case).

(example: office - chair in "the office of the chair")
