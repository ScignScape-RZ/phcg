The compound relation is one of three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs) (the other two being fixed and flat). It is used for

any kind of X0 compounding: noun compounds (e.g., phone book), but also verb and adjective compounds that are more common in other languages (such as Persian or Japanese light verb constructions).
