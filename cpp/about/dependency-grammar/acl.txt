ACL: clausal modifier of noun (adjectival clause)
@
ACL stands for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a nominal.

The acl relation contrasts with the advcl relation, which is used for adverbial clauses that modify a predicate.  The head of the acl relation is the noun that is modified, and the dependent is the head of the clause that modifies the noun.
