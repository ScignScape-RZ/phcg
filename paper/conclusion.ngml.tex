\section{Conclusion}
\p{My analysis in this paper has focused on four 
themes: converging on a general-purpose hypergraph 
model via a standized hypergraph serialization 
format at an Intermediate Representation level; 
generalizing hypergraphs via node, edge, and 
annotation diversification \mdash{} in particular 
\i{procedural} hypegraphs whose hypernodes can have a 
data-collections interface, along with edge-diversification  
into channels (especially in the context of code-representation) 
and annotation-diversification into double-annotated 
edges representing carrier-transfers; 
hypergraph parsers to initialize hypergraphs with 
these extra features from source code; and 
strategies for implementing virtual machines that 
can offer an execution environment for the 
resulting hypergraphs.
