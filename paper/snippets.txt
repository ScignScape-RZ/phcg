In conjunction with a further category-theoretic idea of mapping 
categories to graphs where nodes represent morphisms, this represents a 
generalization on the notion of `i.edges` themselves:  


A general mapping of  
categories to graphs where edges represent morphisms, this represents a 
generalization on the notion of `i.edges` themselves: 



 The demo format relies on the fact that each expression notating a 
minimal graph modification has a similar form %-- actually every 
operation either takes no arguments or a single string argument.  
As such the input text can be `q.compiled` into an array of 
pairs comprised of a pointer-to-member-function and a (possibly 
empty) argument.
