<root> About ANSI SQL query mode 

<root> Some of the content in this topic may not be applicable to some languages . 

<root> You can create SQL queries in one of two ANSI SQL query modes : 

<root> ANSI-89 describes the traditional Jet SQL syntax . 

<root> This mode conforms closely to the ANSI-89 Level 1 specification , but is not ANSI-89 Level 1 compliant . 

<root> Certain ANSI-89 SQL features are not implemented and the wildcard characters conform to the Visual Basic for Applications ( VBA ) specification , not SQL . 

<root> ANSI-92 provides new reserved words , syntax rules , and wildcard characters that enhance your ability to create queries , filters , and SQL statements . 

<root> This mode conforms closely to the ANSI-92 Level 1 specification , but is not ANSI-92 Level 1 compliant . 

<root> This query mode has more of the ANSI syntax , and the wildcard characters conform to the SQL specification . 

<root> In Microsoft Access 2000 using ADOX , you could programmatically create queries that used ANSI-92 SQL syntax . 

<root> However , any queries you created were not visible in the Database window because there was no option to set this mode in the user interface . 

<root> Now in Access 2002 , you can set the ANSI SQL query mode through the user interface for the current database and as the default setting for new databases . 

<root> Why use ANSI-92 SQL ? 

<root> You may want to use ANSI-92 SQL for the following reasons : 

<root> You anticipate upsizing your application in the future to an Access project and want to create queries that will run with minimal changes in a Microsoft SQL Server database . 

<root> You want to take advantage of the new features not found in ANSI-89 SQL , such as : 

<root> Changing security settings by using the GRANT and REVOKE SQL statements 

<root> Using DISTINCT in an aggregate function reference , for example , SUM-DISTINCT-Price 

<root> Using the LIMIT TO nn ROWS clause to limit the number of rows returned by a query 

<root> Why you should avoid mixing queries created under different ANSI SQL query modes 

<root> The ANSI SQL query mode default for new Access databases in 2002 and 2000 file formats 

<root> ANSI-89 is the default setting for a new Access database in 2002 and 2000 file format . 

<root> You can not set the SQL query mode new database default to ANSI-92 in 2000 file format because the option is disabled ; 

<root> ANSI-89 is the only query mode setting available for a database in Access 2000 file format . 

<root> About using connection files 

<root> A connection file stores information about a connection to a data source ( such as an OLE DB data source ) and the data associated with the connection . 

<root> In Microsoft Access , you can use a connection file to bind one or more data access pages to a data source . 

<root> When you open a page , Access reads the connection file that is linked to the page , and based on the contents of the connection file , connects the page to the appropriate data source . 

<root> A connection file uses one of the following file formats : 

<root> Office Data Connection ( .odc ) 

<root> A file format that uses HTML and XML to store the connection information . 

<root> You can view or edit the contents of the file in any text editor . 

<root> Universal Data Link ( .udl ) 

<root> A standard file format provided by Microsoft Data Links to create file-persistent OLE DB data source object definitions . 

<root> Benefits of using a connection file 

<root> Using a connection file simplifies the task of deploying related data access pages . 

<root> Pages that connect to a common data source can share a single connection file . 

<root> If you move or copy the data source , instead of updating the ConnectionString property of each dependent page , you only need to edit the connection information in the connection file to make the pages point to the right location or database . 

<root> Linking a page to a connection file 

<root> When creating a data access page , you can choose whether you want to link the page to a connection file or simply use a connection file without creating a link . 

<root> You can also choose whether you want to use an existing connection file or create a new one . 

<root> Linking to a connection file 

<root> When you establish a link between the connection file and a page , the page 's ConnectionFile property is set to the name of the file . 

<root> Each time you open the page , Access will read the connection file , extract the connection information , and set the ConnectionString property of the page . 

<root> Using a connection file without creating a link 

<root> When creating a page , you can use the contents of a connection file to set the ConnectionString property of the page , but choose not to create a link between the page and the connection file . 

<root> Changing the connection information of a page 

<root> When a connection file is used 

<root> Either change the ConnectionFile property of the page to point to a different connection file , or edit the connection file in a text editor . 

<root> If you choose to edit the connection file , remember that all other pages that use the connection file will also be affected by the changes you make . 

<root> If you edit the ConnectionString property of a page that is linked to a connection file , the link will be broken and the ConnectionFile property will be set to null . 

<root> When a connection file is not used 

<root> Either create a link between the page and a connection file by setting the ConnectionFile property , or edit the ConnectionString property . 

<root> When you create a link , Access will automatically set the ConnectionString property based on the contents of the connection file . 

<root> Convert a previous-version data access page 

<root> A page created using Microsoft Access 2000 must be converted before it can be used with Access 2002 . 

<root> Open the page in Access 2002 Design view . 

<root> Access will create a backup copy of the page ( pagefilename.bak.htm ) at the same location as the original data access page file . 

<root> If you want to revert to the Access 2000 version of the page , delete the converted file , rename the backup copy , and then connect the page to the database . 

<root> If the data access page includes any Microsoft Office Web Components ( a PivotTable list , chart , or spreadsheet ) , only users with a valid Microsoft Office 2002 license will be able to use those components . 

<root> About analyzing data 

<root> Microsoft Access provides several techniques to help you analyze data . 

<root> Create a crosstab query 

<root> You can use a crosstab query to calculate and restructure data for easier analysis . 

<root> Crosstab queries calculate a sum , average , count , or other type of total for data that is grouped by two types of information â€“ one down the left side of the datasheet and another across the top . 

<root> Comparison of a crosstab and a select query 

<root> 1 A select query 

<root> 2 A crosstab query based on the select query 

<root> Add a PivotTable list to a data access page 

<root> A PivotTable list is an interactive table that you can use to analyze data dynamically from within a Web browser . 

<root> At run time , users can change the layout of the PivotTable list . 

<root> They can move the fields that are displayed in the row , column , and data area of the PivotTable list , or add or remove fields from the list . 

<root> Users can also filter , sort , and group data . 

<root> The following illustration shows a PivotTable list on the Orders data access page . 

<root> PivotTable list on a data access page 

<root> View a datasheet or form in PivotTable view 

<root> Access 2002 provides a PivotTable view for datasheets and forms . 

<root> In this view , you can build an interactive report using the fields underlying the datasheet or form . 

<root> The view uses a Microsoft Office PivotTable Component , so you can do all the things that you can do on a PivotTable list . 

<root> You can add fields to the view , move or remove fields , and filter , sort , and group data . 

<root> The following illustration shows the Employees table in PivotTable view . 

<root> Datasheet in PivotTable view 

<root> About customizing the layout of a PivotTable or PivotChart view 

<root> Customizing the layout of a PivotTable view 

<root> You can control how the data is presented in a PivotTable view by customizing the layout . 

<root> A different layout lets you calculate and compare summarized values for different elements in your data , or display summaries for a subset of the data . 

<root> Using the drop areas 

<root> You change the layout by moving the fields to predefined drop areas within the PivotTable view workspace . 

<root> Drop areas in PivotTable view 

<root> 1 Drop areas 

<root> 2 Detail area 

<root> After you move fields to the drop areas so that the drop area captions are covered up , you can still drag additional fields to the areas . 

<root> Moving fields to the row or column areas 

<root> When you move a field to the row area , the unique items of data within the field are displayed down the rows of the PivotTable view . 

<root> When you move a field to the column area , the unique items of data are displayed across the columns . 

<root> Moving fields to the detail area 

<root> To view total or detail data from the underlying record source , move fields to the detail area . 

<root> Moving fields to the filter area 

<root> Filter fields allow you to confine the view to a particular part of the available data . 

<root> For example , when you move a Product field to the filter area , you can display data for one product at a time . 

<root> Moving row or column fields to a higher or lower level 

<root> When a view has multiple row and column fields , the fields that are closest to the detail data are referred to as inner fields . 

<root> The other fields are outer fields . 

<root> You can switch the inner and outer fields . 

<root> Example of inner and outer row fields 

<root> 2 Outer row field 

<root> 2 Inner row field 

<root> 3 Outer field items 

<root> 4 Items for the inner field are repeated for each item in the outer field . 

<root> Adding and removing fields 

<root> The layout of a PivotTable view does not have to include all of the fields that are available from the underlying record source . 

<root> You can also remove fields that you no longer want to see from the PivotTable view layout . 

<root> Customizing the layout of a PivotChart view 

<root> You change the layout of a chart by moving the fields to predefined drop areas within the chart workspace . 

<root> To do this , drop areas must be shown in the chart . 

<root> Drop areas are displayed differently depending on the chart type . 

<root> For example , a series drop area is not displayed for a pie chart because pie charts consist of only one series . 

<root> Additionally , it is written in a style similar to an XML document using a combination of XML-like tags and HTML to create a template for a specific style of output . 

<root> Note that you are not required to link either a CSS file or an XSL style sheet to an XML document in order for Internet Explorer 5 ( and later versions ) to display the document . 

<root> Internet Explorer has a default , built-in style sheet that displays the XML source as a (collapsible|expandable) tree . 

<root> You can use style sheets to insure that the XML-based Web pages on your intranet or Website are consistent and present a uniform appearance without having to add HTML to each page . 

<root> About Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation ( XSLT ) 

<root> XSL for Transformation ( XSLT ) is a specification that is currently under development by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , and supported by Access . 

<root> XSLT is an XML-based language that allows one XML document to be mapped , or transformed , into another XML document . 

<root> This provides a way of transforming an XML document 's presentation information from a source format to a target format and back again . 

<root> Typically , a developer creates an XSL transformation file that , when applied to an XML document during export , interprets or transforms the XML data into a presentation format that can be recognized by another application , such as Service Advertising Protocol ( SAP ) or a custom purchase order format . 

<root> XSLT has many of the constructs ( structures and commands ) found in other programming languages which allow the developer to use variables , loops and iterations , and conditional statements . 

<root> This gives the developer considerable control over the output of the XML data . 

<root> About exporting to XML files 

<root> Exporting data and database objects to an XML file is a convenient way to move and store your information in a format that can readily be used across the Web . 

<root> In Access , you can export the data , the schema ( data structure ) , or both , to XML files . 

<root> Export data to an XML file and , optionally , use an XSLT to transform the data to another format . 

<root> Export the data schema using XML Schema standard ( XSD ) . 

<root> Export the data behind forms and reports to an XML file . 

<root> You can also transform the data to another presentation format using an Extensible Style Language ( XSL ) file during the export process . 

<root> You can export tables , queries , and the data behind forms or reports from a Microsoft Access database ( .mdb ) as well as tables , views , stored produces , functions , and the data behind forms and reports from a Microsoft Access project ( .adp ) . 

<root> Exporting tables , queries , views , datasheets , forms or reports 

<root> You can export a database object as an XML document in several ways : 

<root> You can export just the data from a table , query , datasheet , form , or report into an XML file . 

<root> This data is saved to a file named .xml . 

<root> You can export just the schema ( data structure ) of a table , query , datasheet , form , or report to an XML schema file . 

<root> An XML schema file is a formal specification of the rules for an XML document , providing a series of element names , as well as which elements are allowed in the document and in what combinations . 

<root> If you select to save the schema as XSD , the file is saved as .xsd . 

<root> Note 

<root> When you export a table to an XML document , you can also export related tables . 

<root> For example , if you export a table of Customers Orders , you can also choose to export a related Orders Details table and Customers table into the same file . 

<root> If selected , you can also save the structure of a table , query , datasheet , form , or report into a file that describes the presentation and connection information . 

<root> For forms and reports , this file is saved in an XML-based language called ReportML which provides presentation data as well as a data model for creating a data access page . 

<root> For tables , queries-views , and datasheets , the presentation file is a spreadsheet-like template . 

<root> This file is saved as _report.xml . 

<root> In addition , when you choose to save the data as XML , you can specify that the data be transformed to a custom display format by using an existing .xsl file . 

<root> If no .xsl file is specified , the data is saved in standard XML format . 

<root> Note that if no data is selected for export then a presentation format is also unavailable . 

<root> What is ReportML ? 

<root> ReportML is a " language " developed by Microsoft and specific to Access which can be used to describe Access database objects in XML . 

<root> The ReportML language is made up of a set of tags that describe a form , report or data access page 's properties , events , and attributes . 

<root> When you export data from Access to an XML file , you choose to save the structure of a form or report into a ReportML format . 

<root> The ReportML file can be used to convert the saved data into a data access page . 

<root> Well-formed documents 

<root> Any XML document produced by Access is well-formed , which means that it conforms to the basic rules of XML . 

<root> That is : 

<root> Each XML document must have a unique root element ( an element encompassing the entire document ) . 

<root> All start and end tags match . 

<root> XML tags are case-sensitive . 

<root> For each start tag , there is a corresponding end tag . 

<root> Empty elements can be denoted by a special shorthand tag . 

<root> Again , XML tags are case-sensitive . 

<root> Access ReportML will not write out any empty tags . 

<root> Elements do not overlap . 

<root> In other words , start and end tag must be properly nested within other elements . 

<root> Certain reserve characters are part of the XML syntax and will not be interpreted as themselves if used in the data portion of an element . 

<root> You need to substitute a special character sequence ( called an " entity " by XML ) as follows : 

<root> Character 

<root> Entity 

<root> The following is an example of a well-formed XML document : 

<root> where : 

<root> is a declaration that states that this is an XML document and gives the version number . 

<root> The declaration is optional but is recommended in any XML document . 

<root> is the root element which encompasses the entire document . 

<root> is a start tag and is an end tag which together describe an element of data , in this case , the customer 's name . 

<root> Notice that each tag set has both start and end tags and is case sensitive , and that the tag sets are properly nested within each other . 

<root> Also notice the entity &amp;apos; which will be transformed to an apostrophe when the data is imported by the receiving application . 

<root> The apostrophe has a special purpose in an XML document and can be misinterpreted if used directly in the text . 

<root> The converted data will be displayed as Mom 's Boston Crab Meat . 

<root> White space can be used throughout the document to enhance readability . 

<root> If a schema is specified while exporting from Access , then the XML documents created are considered to be valid XML documents . 

<root> This means that in addition to being well-formed , the documents conform to a defined schema . 

<root> About exporting or copying a PivotTable view to Excel or other applications 

<root> If you are familiar with Microsoft Excel PivotTable reports and want to work with the data in Excel , there are two ways to accomplish this . 

<root> Exporting data to an interactive Excel PivotTable report 

<root> To view and modify the contents of a PivotTable view by using Excel , you can export the PivotTable view to Excel . 

<root> Preparing for export to Excel 

<root> Excel PivotTable reports can not display detail fields . 

<root> When you export to Excel , detail fields will be available on the PivotTable toolbar in Excel , but the fields wo n't be displayed in the report . 

<root> If you want the Excel PivotTable report to reflect the appearance of the PivotTable view , before you export to an Excel PivotTable report , either move all the fields out of the detail area , or hide detail data for items and cells so that the detail area is not displayed . 

<root> After you export 

<root> You might notice some differences in your PivotTable view after you export it to Excel . 

<root> This is because PivotTable views use the Microsoft Office PivotTable Component , and Excel PivotTable reports either do not support certain PivotTable list features , or they implement some features differently . 

<root> For information about differences between PivotTable lists and Excel PivotTable reports , see Excel Help . 

<root> Copying data to another program for noninteractive use 

<root> Copying to other programs 

<root> You can also copy data displayed in a PivotTable view to other programs , such as Microsoft FrontPage . 

<root> When you copy data to a program other than Excel or Word that does not support the HTML format used by PivotTable views , the data is copied as unformatted text . 

<root> About filtering data in PivotTable view 

<root> You can use the filter feature to find specific data values or all data that matches a value . 

<root> Filtering techniques 

<root> Filtering a field ( Autofiltering ) 

<root> You can filter fields in the row , column , and detail areas . 

<root> When you filter a field , you select one or more items of data in the field that you want to view , and hide the other items . 

<root> Filtered PivotTable list or view 

<root> 1 First , the Sport field is filtered to display only Golf sales . 

<root> 2 and then the Quarter field is filtered to display only Golf sales in Qtr3 . 

<root> 3 When you filter a field , the drop-down arrow Field arrow for the filtered field changes to blue instead of black , and the AutoFilter button on the toolbar is selected . 

<root> Filtering a field is particularly helpful when you have a large amount of source data but you want to focus on specific areas . 

<root> 2 Category field Region filtered to show South and West region items 

<root> Conditional filtering 

<root> You can apply a filter to a series or category field to show the top or bottom n items based on a total . 

<root> For example , you can filter for the three cities that generated the most sales or the five products that are least profitable . 

<root> Instead of n items , you can also choose to filter for a certain percentage of items . 

<root> For example , you can filter for the top 25 % or bottom 25 % of salespeople based on the number of orders handled . 

<root> If there are 40 salespeople , after the filter is applied , you will see data for 10 people . 

<root> When you filter a field , you can display the data for a single item , or you can select some items to display and other items to hide . 

<root> Chart with category field 

<root> Chart with category field filtered 

<root> 1 Category field Region showing all items ( not filtered ) 

<root> You can filter on more than one field at a time to further narrow the focus . 

<root> Filtering based on the data in one cell ( Filter by Selection ) 

<root> You can filter a field to display only data that matches the value in a selected cell . 

<root> Filtering by selection is particularly useful for fields in the detail area , when you want to view all of the rows that contain a particular value . 

<root> Using a field in the Filter axis 

<root> You can also filter data by using filter fields . 

<root> When you select one or more items in the filter field , the data that 's displayed and calculated in the entire PivotTable view changes to reflect those items . 

<root> You can add new filter fields or move existing fields to the filter area . 

<root> Filter field example 

<root> 1 Filter field 

<root> Conditional filtering 

<root> Rules for moving an interior horizontal line 

<root> If you move the line upward , the distance between the moving line and the nearest parallel line below remains constant , and the perpendicular line above the moving line contracts . 

<root> If you move the line downward , the distance between the moving line and the nearest parallel line below remains constant , and the perpendicular line above the moving line lengthens . 

<root> Rules for moving an exterior line 

<root> If you are moving the line away from the center of the grid , the nearest parallel line does n't move , and the distance between the line you are moving and the nearest parallel line grows larger . 

<root> If you are moving the line towards the center of the grid , the nearest parallel line does n't move , and the distance between the line you are moving and the nearest parallel line grows smaller . 

<root> Copy a line in a grid of grouped lines 

<root> Select the line you want to copy and press CTRLâ€“C . 

<root> Press CTRLâ€“V to paste the line . 

<root> When you copy an interior vertical line , the new line is halfway between the line you copied and the line to the right of the line you copied . 

<root> When you copy an interior horizontal line , the new line is halfway between the line you copied and the line below the line you copied . 

<root> When you copy an exterior line , the new line is located halfway between the line you copied and the nearest line parallel to the line you copied . 

<root> After you paste the line , you do not need to recreate the group â€“ the new line is automatically part of the group . 

<root> About handling Null values in calculations 

<root> The aggregate functions wo n't include records containing blank ( Null ) values in their calculations . 

<root> For example , the Count function returns a count of all the records without Null values . 

<root> If you want to find the total number of records including those with Nullvalues , use Count with the wildcard character . 

<root> To count Null values when using the other aggregate functions , use the Nz function , which converts Null values to zeroes so they are included in a calculation . 

<root> If some records in one of the fields you used in the expression might have a Null value , you can convert the Null value to zero using the Nz function as shown in the following example : 

<root> About installing , licensing , and distributing Office Web Components 

<root> When you design a Web page using Microsoft Office Web Components , any user with a Microsoft Office 2002 license can interact with the components in the browser to the level of interactivity you provide . 

<root> That is , a user with an appropriate license can make changes to data in a spreadsheet , change formatting , drag fields in a chart or PivotTable List , and so on , as long as you did n't protect these options at design time . 

<root> Users with an Office 2002 license can also create , design , and modify components in a design environment such as Microsoft FrontPage or Microsoft Access . 

<root> Users who do not have Office 2002 licenses can view the components and the data in them , and can print the view of the components , but they can not interact with the components or manipulate them in a design environment . 

<root> This means that if you distribute a Web page that uses components , users who have Office 2002 licenses will have access to all functionality provided , but users without a license can only view the data and information you 've provided . 

<root> Installing the Office Web Components 

<root> Microsoft Office Web Components are installed with Microsoft Office 2002 and Microsoft Office applications , or they can be installed separately from an installation point provided by the Web page designer . 

<root> When you distribute a Web page that uses components , users who do not have the components installed will be prompted to install the components , provided the Web page designer configures the components to do so . 

<root> The Web page designer must also provide an installation point for the components and a pointer to that location on the component installation page . 

<root> For more information , see the Microsoft Office 2002 Resource Kit . 

<root> Once the Office Web Components are installed , users who have access to an Office 2002 license will be able to interact with and make changes to the components . 

<root> Users without licenses will be able to view and print the components and the data in them , but they can not interact with or make changes to them . 

<root> Details on licensing and functionality 

<root> Office 2002 installed on computer 

<root> Users have full functionality and interactivity with components , including run-time and design-time capabilities . 

<root> Office 2002 application installed on computer 

<root> Users can interact with the component in design mode in that application only ( not in the browser or in other applications ) . 

<root> Office 2002 site license ( user does n't have Office 2002 installed on computer , but user 's organization has an enterprise or site license agreement ) 

<root> However , the Web page designer must provide a location from which components can be downloaded , and must reference the site license in a license package file ( .lpk ) that is associated with one or more Web pages . 

<root> You use the License Package Authoring Tool to create an appropriate license file for pages . 

<root> For more information , see MSDN Online . 

<root> No Office 2002 , Office 2002 applications , or site licenses 

<root> Users can view and print the components in view-only mode , but they can not interact with the components or use the design capabilities . 

<root> About avoiding the mixing of queries created under different ANSI SQL query modes 

<root> The two ANSI SQL query modes , ANSI-89 and ANSI-92 , are not compatible . 

<root> When you create a Microsoft Access database , you need to decide which query mode you are going to use , because mixing queries created in both query modes could produce runtime errors or unexpected results . 

<root> The range of data types , reserved words , and wildcard characters are different in each query mode . 

<root> Example of a query using wildcard characters 

<root> A query that uses wildcard characters in a criteria expression can produce different results under each query mode . 

<root> For example , if you run : 

<root> An ANSI-89 SQL query in a database set to ANSI-92 query mode , such as : 

<root> SELECT asterisk FROM Customers WHERE Country Like U % 

<root> It returns all customers from a (country|region) named " U % " , not all (countries|regions) beginning with the letter " U " , because the percent sign ( % ) is not a wildcard character in ANSI-89 SQL . 

<root> Example of a query with a duplicate field and alias name 

<root> If a query uses an alias that is the same as a base column name and you create a calculated field using the ambiguous name , the query will produce different results under each query mode . 

<root> How to avoid problems caused by mixing queries under different ANSI SQL query modes in the same database 

<root> In general , avoid doing the following to prevent problems caused by mixing queries created under different ANSI SQL query modes : 

<root> Converting an Access database set to ANSI-92 SQL query mode from 2002 file format to 2000 or 97 file format . 

<root> ANSI-92 SQL query mode is only supported in the 2002 file format . 

<root> Changing the ANSI SQL query mode for the current database after you 've created one or more queries . 

<root> If you must do this , retest the existing queries to ensure that they still run or produce expected results , and rewrite the queries if necessary . 

<root> Importing queries created under one ANSI SQL query mode into an Access database set to another mode , or exporting queries created under one ANSI SQL query mode to an Access database set to another mode . 

<root> Changing the ANSI SQL query mode in an existing application . 

<root> This could break your application and require rewriting your application . 

<root> In Access 2000 , you can only programmatically change the ANSI SQL query mode and any queries created under ANSI-92 mode were hidden in the Database window . 

<root> In Access 2002 , you or a user can change ANSI SQL query mode through the user interface and ANSI-92 queries are no longer hidden in the Database window , so you should prevent accidental or intentional changes to the ANSI SQL query mode of your application by protecting your code and preventing the changing of the query mode through the application 's user interface . 

<root> Using ambiguous aliases and column names . 

<root> To avoid confusion , ensure that aliases and column names are always unique in an SQL statement . 

<root> About how Access searches for reference libraries 

<root> The Visual Basic project of a Microsoft Access file contains references to object libraries , and it can also contain references to other files , including other Access files . 

<root> The locations of referenced files are specified in the References dialog box that is available from the References command on the Tools menu in the Visual Basic Editor . 

<root> When you open an Access file , if Access does n't find a referenced file in the specified location , it searches for the reference as follows . 

<root> First , Access searches for a RefLibPaths key in the following location in the Microsoft Windows Registry : 

<root> If the key exists , Access checks for the existence of a value name that matches the name of the referenced file . 

<root> If it finds a matching value name , Access loads the reference from the path specified in the corresponding value data . 

<root> If Access does n't find a RefLibPaths key , it searches for the referenced file in the locations listed below in the following order : 

<root> Application folder containing the application ( the folder where Msaccess.exe is located ) . 

<root> Current folder . 

<root> System folders ( the System and System32 folders located in the Windows or WINNT folder ) . 

<root> PATH environment variable . 

<root> For more information about environment variables , see Windows Help . 

<root> The folder that contains the Access file , and any subfolders located in that folder . 

<root> If Access still ca n't find the reference after performing this search , you must fix the reference manually . 

<root> About saving an object as a data access page 

<root> You can also save tables , views , stored procedures , functions , and forms in a Microsoft Access project as a data access page . 

<root> Saving an object as a data access page enables you to quickly convert an object into a page , and allows users of your application to review , enter , and analyze data over the Internet or an intranet . 

<root> For example , if you have a sales report that you want to make available over the Web , instead of creating a data access page and customizing it to look like the sales report , you can save the report as a data access page . 

<root> Using the Save As command on the File menu will save a data access page that is similar in appearance and functionality to the original report . 

<root> If you want to make changes to the design of the resulting page , you can open the page in Design view and make any changes you want . 

<root> The default view â€“ the view in which the object is open when you carry out the Save As command â€“ determines the design of the data access page . 

<root> The following table lists the outcome of each view . 

<root> Default view ( current view ) 

<root> Outcome 

<root> Datasheet view 

<root> A page that has controls arranged as a datasheet 

<root> Form view 

<root> PivotTable view 

<root> A page that uses a Microsoft Office PivotTable Component 

<root> PivotChart view 

<root> A page that uses a Microsoft Office Chart Component 

<root> If you carry out the Save As command after making changes to the object 's formatting , but before saving your changes , the current formatting â€“ not the saved formatting â€“ will be used to create the page . 

<root> Implications of using the Save As command 

<root> Control support 

<root> Such controls will be left unbound on a page . 

<root> Subforms and subreports 

<root> Subforms and subreports on a form or report are not converted when you carry out the Save As command . 

<root> However , you can open the page in Design view and create additional group levels to make the page appear similar to the original object . 

<root> Control naming 

<root> Controls on forms and reports need not have unique names , but names of controls on a page must be unique . 

<root> While creating the page , Access will change control names that are not unique . 

<root> Controls in the header and footer sections 

<root> Controls in the Form , Report , or page header sections will be placed as unbound controls in the caption section of the outermost group level . 

<root> Controls in the Form , Report , or page footer sections will be placed as unbound controls in the navigation section of the outermost group level . 

<root> Code in a form or report that can not run from a data access page is imported into the page as a comment block at the end of the document . 

<root> Pictures in a form or report are converted to bitmaps and placed in a folder named " Images " . 

<root> Group level properties 

<root> By default , the AllowAdditions , AllowDeletions , and AllowEdits properties of all group levels in a data access page created from a report are set to False . 

<root> However , you can open the page in Design view and change the property settings . 

<root> Expressions that refer to form or subform properties are ignored . 

<root> About sorting data in PivotTable or PivotChart view 

<root> It was a wrong number that started it , the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night , and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not . 

<root> Much later , when he was able to think about the things that happened to him , he would conclude that nothing was real except chance . 

<root> But that was much later . 

<root> In the beginning , there was simply the event and its consequences . 

<root> Whether it might have turned out differently , or whether it was all predetermined with the first word that came from the stranger 's mouth , is not the question . 

<root> The question is the story itself , and whether or not it means something is not for the story to tell . 

<root> As for Quinn , there is little that need detain us . 

<root> Who he was , where he came from , and what he did are of no great importance . 

<root> We know , for example , that he was thirty-five years old . 

<root> We know that he had once been married , had once been a father , and that both his wife and son were now dead . 

<root> We also know that he wrote books . 

<root> To be precise , we know that he wrote mystery novels . 

<root> These works were written under the name of William Wilson , and he produced them at the rate of about one a year , which brought in enough money for him to live modestly in a small New York apartment . 

<root> Because he spent no more than five or six months on a novel , for the rest of the year he was free to do as he wished . 

<root> He read many books , he looked at paintings , he went to the movies . 

<root> In the summer he watched baseball on television ; in the winter he went to the opera . 

<root> More than anything , however , what he liked to do was walk . 

<root> Nearly every day , rain or shine , hot or cold , he would leave his apartment to walk through the city â€“ never really going anywhere , but simply going wherever his legs happened to take him . 

<root> New York was an inexhaustible space , a labyrinth of endless steps , and no matter how far he walked , no matter how well he came to know its neighborhoods and streets , it always left him with the feeling of being lost . 

<root> Lost , not only in the city , but within himself as well . 

<root> Each time he took a walk , he felt as though he were leaving himself behind , and by giving himself up to the movement of the streets , by reducing himself to a seeing eye , he was able to escape the obligation to think , and this , more than anything else , brought him a measure of peace , a salutatory emptiness within . 

<root> The world was outside of him , around him , before him , and the speed with which it kept changing made it impossible for him to dwell on any one thing for very long . 

<root> Motion was of the essence , the act of putting one foot in front of the other and allowing himself to follow the drift of his own body . 

<root> By wandering aimlessly , all places became equal , and it no longer mattered where he was . 

<root> On his best walks , he was able to feel that he was nowhere . 

<root> New York was the nowhere he had built around himself , and he realized that he had no intention of ever leaving it again . 

<root> In the past , Quinn had been more ambitious . 

<root> As a young man , he had published several books of poetry , had written plays , critical essays , and had worked on a number of long translations . 

<root> But quite abruptly , he had given up all that . 

<root> A part of him had died , he told his friends , and he did not want it coming back to haunt him . 

<root> It was then that he had taken on the name of William Wilson . 

<root> Quinn was no longer that part of him that could write books , and although in many ways Quinn continued to exist , he no longer existed for anyone but himself . 

<root> The next morning , Quinn woke up earlier than he had in several weeks . 

<root> As he drank his coffee , buttered his toast , and read through the baseball scores in the paper ( the Mets had lost again , two to one , on a ninth inning error ) , it did not occur to him that he was going to show up for his appointment . 

<root> Even that locution , ' his appointment ' , seemed odd to him . 

<root> It was n't his appointment , it was Paul Auster 's . 

<root> And who that person was he had no idea . 

<root> Nevertheless , as time wore on he found himself doing a good imitation of a man preparing to go out . 

<root> He cleared the table of the breakfast dishes , tossed the newspaper on the couch , went into the bathroom , showered , shaved , went on to the bedroom wrapped in two towels , opened the closet and picked out his clothes for the day . 

<root> He found himself tending toward a jacket and a tie . 

<root> Quinn had not worn a tie since the funerals of his wife and son , and he could not even remember if he still owned one . 

<root> But there it was , hanging amidst the debris of his wardrobe . 

<root> He dismissed a white shirt as too formal , however , and instead chose a gray and red check affair to go with the gray tie . 

<root> He put them on in a kind of trance . 

<root> It was not until he had his hand on the doorknob that he began to suspect what he was doing . 

<root> I seem to be going out , he said to himself . 

<root> But if I am going out , where exactly am I going ? 

<root> An hour later , as he climbed from the number 4 bus at 70th Street and Fifth Avenue , he still had not answered the question . 

<root> To one side of him was the park , green in the morning sun , with sharp , fleeting shadows ; to the other side was the Frick , white and austere , as if abandoned to the dead . 

<root> He thought for a moment of Vermeer 's Soldier and Young Girl Smiling , trying to remember the expression on the girl 's face , the exact position of her hands around the cup , the red back of the faceless man . 

<root> In his mind , he caught a glimpse of the blue map on the wall and the sunlight pouring through the window , so like the sunlight that surrounded him now . 

<root> He was walking . 

<root> He was crossing the street and moving eastward . 

<root> At Madison Avenue he turned right and went south for a block , then turned left and saw where he was . 

<root> I seem to have arrived , he said to himself . 

<root> He stood before the building and paused . 

<root> It suddenly did not seem to matter anymore . 

<root> He felt remarkably calm , as if everything had already happened to him . 

<root> As he opened the door that would lead him into the lobby , he gave himself one last word of advice . 

<root> If all this is really happening , he said , then I must keep my eyes open . 

<root> It was a woman who opened the apartment door . 

<root> For some reason , Quinn had not expected this , and it threw him off track . 

<root> Already , things were happening too fast . 

<root> Before he had a chance to absorb the woman 's presence , to describe her to himself and form his impressions , she was talking to him , forcing him to respond . 

<root> Therefore , even in those first moments , he had lost ground , was starting to fall behind himself . 

<root> Later , when he had time to reflect on these events , he would manage to piece together his encounter with the woman . 

<root> But that was the work of memory , and remembered things , he knew , had a tendency to subvert the things remembered . 

<root> As a consequence , he could never be sure of any of it . 

<root> The woman was thirty , perhaps thirty-five ; average height at best ; hips a touch wide , or else voluptuous , depending on your point of view ; dark hair , dark eyes , and a look in those eyes that was at once self-contained and vaguely seductive . 

<root> She wore a black dress and very red lipstick . 

<root> Mr Auster ? A tentative smile ; a questioning tilt to the head . 

<root> That 's right , said Quinn . 

<root> I 'm Virginia Stillman , the woman began . 

<root> Peter 's wife . 

<root> He 's been waiting for you since eight o'clock . 

<root> The appointment was for ten , said Quinn , glancing at his watch . 

<root> It was exactly ten . 

<root> He 's been frantic , the woman explained . 

<root> I 've never seen him like this before . 

<root> He just could n't wait . 

<root> She opened the door for Quinn . 

<root> As he crossed the threshold and entered the apartment , he could feel himself going blank , as if his brain had suddenly shut off . 

<root> He had wanted to take in the details of what he was seeing , but the task was somehow beyond him at that moment . 

<root> The apartment loomed up around him as a kind of blur . 

<root> He realized that it was large , perhaps five or six rooms , and that it was richly furnished , with numerous art objects , silver ashtrays , and elaborately framed paintings on the walls . 

<root> But that was all . 

<root> No more than a general impression â€“ even though he was there , looking at those things with his own eyes . 

<root> He found himself sitting on a sofa , alone in the living room . 

<root> He remembered now that Mrs. Stillman had told him to wait there while she went to find her husband . 

<root> He could n't say how long it had been . 

<root> Surely no more than a minute or two . 

<root> But from the way the light was coming through the windows , it seemed to be almost noon . 

<root> It did not occur to him , however , to consult his watch . 

<root> The smell of Virginia Stillman 's perfume hovered around him , and he began to imagine what she looked like without any clothes on . 

<root> Then he thought about what Max Work might have been thinking , had he been there . 

<root> He decided to light a cigarette . 

<root> He blew the smoke into the room . 

<root> It pleased him to watch it leave his mouth in gusts , disperse , and take on new definition as the light caught it . 

<root> He heard the sound of someone entering the room behind him . 

<root> Quinn stood up from the sofa and turned around , expecting to see Mrs. Stillman . 

<root> Instead , it was a young man , dressed entirely in white , with the white-blond hair of a child . 

<root> Uncannily , in that first moment , Quinn thought of his own dead son . 

<root> Then , just as suddenly as the thought had appeared , it vanished . 

<root> Peter Stillman walked into the room and sat down in a red velvet armchair opposite Quinn . 

<root> He said not a word as he made his way to his seat , nor did he acknowledge Quinn 's presence . 

<root> The act of moving from one place to another seemed to require all his attention , as though not to think of what he was doing would reduce him to immobility . 

<root> Quinn had never seen anyone move in such a manner , and he realized at once that this was the same person he had spoken to on the phone . 

<root> The body acted almost exactly as the voice had : machine-like , fitful , alternating between slow and rapid gestures , rigid and yet expressive , as if the operation were out of control , not quite corresponding to the will that lay behind it . 

<root> It seemed to Quinn that Stillman 's body had not been used for a long time and that all its functions had been relearned , so that motion had become a conscious process , each movement broken down into its component submovements , with the result that all flow and spontaneity had been lost . 

<root> It was like watching a marionette trying to walk without strings . 

<root> Everything about Peter Stillman was white . 

<root> White shirt , open at the neck ; white pants , white shoes , white socks . 

<root> Against the pallor of his skin , the flaxen thinness of his hair , the effect was almost transparent , as though one could see through to the blue veins behind the skin of his face . 

<root> This blue was almost the same as his eyes : a milky blue that seemed to dissolve into a mixture of sky and clouds . 

<root> Quinn could not imagine himself addressing a word to this person . 

<root> It was as though Stillman 's presence was a command to be silent . 

<root> Stillman settled slowly into his chair and at last turned his attention to Quinn . 

<root> As their eyes met , Quinn suddenly felt that Stillman had become invisible . 

<root> He could see him sitting in the chair across from him , but at the same time it felt as though he was not there . 

<root> It occurred to Quinn that perhaps Stillman was blind . 

<root> But no , that did not seem possible . 

<root> The man was looking at him , even studying him , and if recognition did not flicker across his face , it still held something more than a blank stare . 

<root> Quinn did not know what to do . 

<root> He sat there dumbly in his seat , looking back at Stillman . 

<root> A long time passed . 

<root> No questions , please , the young man said at last . 

<root> Yes . No . Thank you . 

<root> He paused for a moment . 

<root> I am Peter Stillman . 

<root> I say this of my free will . Yes . 

<root> That is not my real name . No . 

<root> Of course , my mind is not all it should be . 

<root> But nothing can be done about that . No . About that . No , no . Not anymore . 

<root> You sit here and think : who is this person talking to me ? 

<root> What are these words coming from his mouth ? 

<root> I will tell you . 

<root> Or else I will not tell you . 

<root> At the corner of 72nd Street and Madison Avenue , he waved down a cab . 

<root> As the car rattled through the park toward the West Side , Quinn looked out the window and wondered if these were the same trees that Peter Stillman saw when he walked out into the air and the light . 

<root> He wondered if Peter saw the same things as he did , or whether the world was a different place for him . 

<root> And if a tree was not a tree , he wondered what it really was . 

<root> After the cab had dropped him off in front of his house , Quinn realized that he was hungry . 

<root> He had not eaten since breakfast early that morning . 

<root> It was strange , he thought , how quickly time had passed in the Stillman apartment . 

<root> If his calculations were correct , he had been there for more than fourteen hours . 

<root> Within himself , however , it felt as though his stay had lasted three or four hours at most . 

<root> He shrugged at the discrepancy and said to himself , I must learn to look at my watch more often . 

<root> He retraced his path along 107th Street , turned left on Broadway , and began walking uptown , looking for a suitable place to eat . 

<root> A bar did not appeal to him tonight â€“ eating in the dark , the press of boozy chatter â€“ although normally he would have welcomed it . 

<root> As he crossed 112th Street , he saw that the Heights Luncheonette was still open and decided to go in . 

<root> It was a brightly lit yet dreary place , with a large rack of girlie magazines on one wall , an area for stationery supplies , another area for newspapers , several tables for patrons , and a long Formica counter with swivel stools . 

<root> A tall Puerto Rican man in a white cardboard chef 's hat stood behind the counter . 

<root> It was his job to make the food , which consisted mainly of gristle-studded hamburger patties , bland sandwiches with pale tomatoes and wilted lettuce , milkshakes , egg creams , and buns . 

<root> To his right , ensconced behind the cash register , was the boss , a small balding man with curly hair and a concentration camp number tattoed on his forearm , 

<root> lording it over his domain of cigarettes , pipes , and cigars . 

<root> He sat there impassively , reading the night-owl edition of the next morning 's Daily News . 

<root> The place was almost deserted at that hour . 

<root> He would arrive early , never later than seven o'clock and sit there with a take-out coffee , a buttered roll , and an open newspaper on his lap , watching the glass door of the hotel . 

<root> By eight o'clock Stillman would come out , always in his long brown overcoat , carrying a large , old-fashioned carpet bag . 

<root> For two weeks this routine did not vary . The old man would wander through the streets of the neighborhood , advancing slowly , sometimes by the merest of increments , pausing , moving on again , pausing once more , as though each step had to be weighed and measured before it could take its place among the sum total of steps . 

<root> Moving in this manner was difficult for Quinn . 

<root> He was used to walking briskly , and all this starting and stopping and shuffling began to be a strain , as though the rhythm of his body was being disrupted . 

<root> He was hare in pursuit of the tortoise , and again and again he had to remind himself to hold back . 

<root> What Stillman did on these walks remained something of a mystery to Quinn . 

<root> He could , of course , see with his own eyes what happened , and all these things he dutifully recorded in his red notebook . But the meaning of these things continued to elude him . 

<root> Stillman never seemed to be going anywhere in particular , nor did he seem to know where he was . 

<root> and yet , as if by conscious design , he kept to a narrowly circumscribed area , bounded on the north by Riverside Park , and on the east by Amsterdam Avenue . 

<root> No matter how haphazard his journeys seemed to be â€“ and each day his itinerary was different â€“ Stillman never crossed these borders . 

<root> Such precision baffled Quinn , for in all other respects Stillman seemed to be aimless . 

<root> As he walked , Stillman did not look up . 

<root> His eyes were permanently fixed on the pavement , as though he were searching for something . 

<root> Indeed , every now and then he would stoop down , pick some object off the ground , and examine it closely , turning it over and over in his hand . 

<root> It made Quinn think of an archeologist inspecting a shard at some prehistoric ruin . 

<root> Occasionally , after poring over an object in this way , Stillman would toss it back onto the sidewalk . But more often than not he would open his bag and lay the object gently inside it . 

<root> Then , reaching into one of his coat pockets , he would remove a red notebook â€“ similar to Quinn 's but smaller â€“ and write in it with great concentration for a minute or two . 

<root> Having completed this operation , he would return the notebook to his pocket , pick up his bag , and continue on his way . 

<root> As far as Quinn could tell , the objects Stillman collected were valueless . 

<root> They seemed to be no more than broken things , discarded things , stray bits of junk . 

<root> Over the days that passed , Quinn noted a collapsible umbrella shorn of its material , the severed head of a rubber doll , a black glove , the bottom of a shattered light bulb , several pieces of printed matter ( sogged magazines , shredded newspapers ) , a torn photograph , anonymous machinery parts , and sundry other clumps of flotsam he could not identify . 

<root> The fact that Stillman took this scavenging seriously intrigued Quinn , but he could do no more than observe , write down what he saw in the red notebook , hover stupidly on the surface of things . 

<root> At the same time , it pleased him to know that Stillman also had a red notebook , as if this formed a secret link between them . 

<root> Quinn suspected that Stillman 's red notebook contained answers to the questions that had been accumulating in his mind , and he began to plot various stratagems for stealing it from the old man . 

<root> But the time had not yet come for such a step . 

<root> Other than picking up objects from the street , Stillman seemed to do nothing . 

<root> Every now and then he would stop somewhere for a meal . 

<root> Occasionally he would bump into someone and mumble an apology . 

<root> Once a car nearly ran him over as he was crossing the street . 

<root> Stillman did not talk to anyone , did not go into any stores , did not smile . 

<root> He seemed neither happy nor sad . 

<root> Twice , when his scavenging haul had been unusually large , he returned to the hotel in the middle of the day and remerged a few minutes later with an empty bag . 

<root> On most days he spent at least several hours in Riverside Park , walking methodically along the macadam footpaths or else thrashing through the bushes with a stick . 

<root> His quest for objects did not abate amidst the greenery . 

<root> Stones , leaves , and twigs all found their way into his bag . 

<root> Once , Quinn observed , he even stooped down for a dried dog turd , sniffed it carefully , and kept it . 

<root> It was in the park , too , that Stillman rested . 

<root> In the afternoon , often following his lunch , he would sit on a bench and gaze out across the Hudson . 

<root> Once , on a particularly warm day , Quinn saw him sprawled out on the grass asleep . 

<root> When darkness came , Stillman would eat dinner at the Apollo Coffee Shop on 97th Street and Broadway and then return to his hotel for the night . 

<root> Not once did he try to contact his son . 

<root> This was confirmed by Virginia Stillman , whom Quinn called each night after returning home . 

<root> The essential thing was to stay involved . 

<root> Little by little , Quinn began to feel cut off from his original intentions , and he wondered now if he had not embarked on a meaningless project . 

<root> It was possible , of course , that Stillman was merely biding his time , lulling the world into lethargy before striking . 

<root> But that would assume he was aware of being watched , and Quinn felt that was unlikely . 

<root> He had done his job well so far , keeping at a discreet distance from the old man , blending into the traffic of the street , neither calling attention to himself nor taking drastic measures to keep himself hidden . 

<root> On the other hand , it was possible that Stillman had known all along that he would be watched â€“ had even known it in advance â€“ and therefore had not taken the trouble to discover who the particular watcher was . 

<root> If being followed was a certainty , what did it matter ? 

<root> A watcher , once discovered , could always be replaced by another . 

<root> This view of the situation comforted Quinn , and he decided to believe in it , even though he had no grounds for belief . 

<root> Either Stillman knew what he was doing or he did n't . 

<root> and if he did n't , then Quinn was going nowhere , was wasting his time . 

<root> How much better it was to believe that all his steps were actually to some purpose . 

<root> If this interpretation required knowledge on Stillman 's part , then Quinn would accept this knowledge as an article of faith , at least for the time being . 

<root> There remained the problem of how to occupy his thoughts as he followed the old man . 

<root> Quinn was used to wandering . 

<root> His excursions through the city had taught him to understand the connectedness of inner and outer . 

<root> Using aimless motion as a technique of reversal , on his best days he could bring the outside in and thus usurp the sovereignty of inwardness . 

<root> By flooding himself with externals , by drowning himself out of himself , he had managed to exert some small degree of control over his fits of despair . 

<root> Wandering , therefore , was a kind of mindlessness . 

<root> But following Stillman was not wandering . 

<root> Stillman could wander , he could stagger like a blindman from one spot to another , but this was a privilege denied to Quinn . 

<root> For he was obliged now to concentrate on what he was doing , even if it was next to nothing . 

<root> Time and again his thoughts would begin to drift , and soon thereafter his steps would follow suit . 

<root> This meant that he was constantly in danger of quickening his pace and crashing into Stillman from behind . 

<root> To guard against this mishap he devised several different methods of deceleration . 

<root> The first was to tell himself that he was no longer Daniel Quinn . 

<root> He was Paul Auster now , and with each step he took he tried to fit more comfortably into the strictures of that transformation . 

<root> Auster was no more than a name to him , a husk without content . 

<root> To be Auster meant being a man with no interior , a man with no thoughts . 

<root> Stillman was gone now . 

<root> The old man had become part of the city . 

<root> He was a speck , a punctuation mark , a brick in an endless wall of bricks . 

<root> Quinn could walk through the streets every day for the rest of his life , and still he would not find him . 

<root> Everything had been reduced to chance , a nightmare of numbers and probabilities . 

<root> There were no clues , no leads , no moves to be made . 

<root> Quinn backtracked in his mind to the beginning of the case . 

<root> His job had been to protect Peter , not to follow Stillman . 

<root> That had simply been a method , a way of trying to predict what would happen . 

<root> By watching Stillman , the theory was that he would learn what his intentions were toward Peter . 

<root> He had followed the old man for two weeks . 

<root> What , then , could he conclude ? 

<root> Not much . 

<root> Stillman 's behavior had been too obscure to give any hints . 

<root> There were , of course , certain extreme measures that they could take . 

<root> He could suggest to Virginia Stillman that she get an unlisted telephone number . 

<root> That would eliminate the disturbing calls , at least temporarily . 

<root> If that failed , she and Peter could move . 

<root> They could leave the neighborhood , perhaps leave the city altogether . 

<root> At the very worst , they could take on new identities , live under different names . 

<root> This last thought reminded him of something important . 

<root> Until now , he realized , he had never seriously questioned the circumstances of his hiring . 

<root> Things had happened too quickly , and he had taken it for granted that he could fill in for Paul Auster . 

<root> Once he had taken the leap into that name , he had stopped thinking about Auster himself . 

<root> If this man was as good a detective as the Stillmans thought he was , perhaps he would be able to help with the case . 

<root> Quinn would make a clean breast of it , Auster would forgive him , and together they would work to save Peter Stillman . 

<root> He looked through the yellow pages for the Auster Detective Agency . 

<root> There was no listing . 

<root> In the white pages , however , he found the name . 

<root> There was one Paul Auster in Manhattan , living on Riverside Drive â€“ not far from Quinn 's own house . 

<root> There was no mention of a detective agency , but that did not necessarily mean anything . 

<root> It could be that Auster had so much work he did n't need to advertise . 

<root> Quinn picked up the phone and was about to dial when he thought better of it . 

<root> This was too important a conversation to leave to the phone . 

<root> He did not want to run the risk of being brushed off . 

<root> Since Auster did not have an office , that meant he worked at home . 

<root> Quinn would go there and talk to him face to face . 

<root> The rain had stopped now , and although the sky was still gray , far to the west Quinn could see a tiny shift of light seeping through the clouds . 

<root> As he walked up Riverside Drive , he became aware of the fact that he was no longer following Stillman . 

<root> It felt as though he had lost half of himself . 

<root> For two weeks he had been tied by an invisible thread to the old man . 

<root> Whatever Stillman had done , he had done ; wherever Stillman had gone , he had gone . 

<root> His body was not accustomed to this new freedom , and for the first few blocks he walked at the old shuffling pace . 

<root> The spell was over , and yet his body did not know it . 

<root> Auster 's building was in the middle of the long block that ran between 116th and 119th Streets , just south of Riverside Church and Grant 's Tomb . 

<root> It was a well-kept place , with polished doorknobs and clean glass , and it had an air of bourgeois sobriety that appealed to Quinn at that moment . 

<root> Auster 's apartment was on the eleventh floor , and Quinn rang the buzzer , expecting to hear a voice speak to him through the intercom . 

<root> But the door buzzer answered him without any conversation . 

<root> Quinn pushed the door open , walked through the lobby , and rode the elevator to the eleventh floor . 

<root> It was a man who opened the apartment door . 

<root> He was a tall dark fellow in his mid-thirties , with rumpled clothes and a two-day beard . 

<root> In his right hand , fixed between his thumb and first two fingers , he held an uncapped fountain pen , still poised in a writing position . 

<root> The man seemed surprised to find a stranger standing before him . 

<root> Yes ? he asked tentatively . 

<root> Quinn spoke in the politest tone he could muster . Were you expecting someone else ? 

<root> My wife , as a matter of fact . 

<root> That 's why I rang the buzzer without asking who it was . 

<root> I 'm sorry to disturb you , Quinn apologized . But I 'm looking for Paul Auster . 

<root> I 'm Paul Auster , said the man . 

<root> I wonder if I could talk to you . It 's quite important . 

<root> You 'll have to tell me what it 's about first . 

<root> I hardly know myself . Quinn gave Auster an honest look . 

<root> It 's complicated , I 'm afraid . Very complicated . 

<root> Do you have a name ? 

<root> I 'm sorry . Of course I do . Quinn . 

<root> The name seemed to suggest something to Auster , and he paused for a moment abstractedly , as if searching through his memory . 

<root> Quinn , he muttered to himself . 

<root> I know that name from somewhere . He went silent again , straining harder to dredge up the answer . 

<root> You are n't a poet , are you ? 

<root> I used to be , said Quinn . 

<root> But I have n't written poems for a long time now . 

<root> You did a book several years ago , did n't you ? 

<root> I think the title was Unfinished Business . 

<root> A little book with a blue cover . 

<root> Yes . That was me . 

<root> I liked it very much . 

<root> I kept hoping to see more of your work . 

<root> In fact , I even wondered what had happened to you . 

<root> I 'm still here . Sort of . 

<root> Auster opened the door wider and gestured for Quinn to enter the apartment . 

<root> It was a pleasant enough place inside ; oddly shaped , with several long corridors , books cluttered everywhere , pictures on the walls by artists Quinn did not know , and a few children 's toys scattered on the floor â€“ a red truck , a brown bear , a green space monster . 

<root> Auster led him to the living room , gave him a frayed upholstered chair to sit in , and then went off to the kitchen to fetch some beer . 

<root> He returned with two bottles , placed them on a wooden crate that served as the coffee table , and sat down on the sofa across from Quinn . 

<root> Was it some kind of literary thing you wanted to talk about ? Auster began . 

<root> No , said Quinn . 

<root> In the end , they are actually successful . 

<root> The book was just one of their ploys . 

<root> The idea was to hold a mirror up to Don Quixote 's madness to record each of his absurd and ludicrous delusions , so that when he finally read the book himself , he would see the error of his ways . 

<root> I like that . 

<root> Yes . But there 's one last twist . 

<root> Don Quixote , in my view , was not really mad . 

<root> He only pretended to be . 

<root> In fact , he orchestrated the whole thing himself . 

<root> Remember : throughout the book Don Quixote is preoccupied by the question of posterity . 

<root> Again and again he wonders how accurately his chronicler will record his adventures . 

<root> This implies knowledge on his part ; he knows beforehand that this chronicler exists . 

<root> And who else is it but Sancho Panza , the faithful squire whom Don Quixote has chosen for exactly this purpose ? 

<root> In the same way , he chose the three others to play the roles he destined for them . 

<root> It was Don Quixote who engineered the Benengali quartet . 

<root> And not only did he select the authors , it was probably he who translated the Arabic manuscript back into Spanish . 

<root> We should n't put it past him . 

<root> For a man so skilled in the art of disguise , darkening his skin and donning the clothes of a Moor could not have been very difficult . 

<root> I like to imagine that scene in the marketplace at Toledo . 

<root> Cervantes hiring Don Quixote to decipher the story of Don Quixote himself . 

<root> There 's great beauty to it . 

<root> But you still have n't explained why a man like Don Quixote would disrupt his tranquil life to engage in such an elaborate hoax . 

<root> That 's the most interesting part of all . 

<root> In my opinion , Don Quixote was conducting an experiment . 

<root> He wanted to test the gullibility of his fellow men . 

<root> Would it be possible , he wondered , to stand up before the world and with the utmost conviction spew out lies and nonsense ? 

<root> To say that windmills were knights , that a barber 's basin was a helmet , that puppets were real people ? 

<root> Would it be possible to persuade others to agree with what he said , even though they did not believe him ? 

<root> In other words , to what extent would people tolerate blasphemies if they gave them amusement ? 

<root> The answer is obvious , is n't it ? 

<root> To any extent . 

<root> For the proof is that we still read the book . 

<root> It remains highly amusing to us . 

<root> And that 's finally all anyone wants out of a book â€“ to be amused . 

<root> Auster leaned back on the sofa , smiled with a certain ironic pleaure , and lit a cigarette . 

<root> The man was obviously enjoying himself , but the precise nature of that pleasure eluded Quinn . 

<root> It seemed to be a kind of soundless laughter , a joke that stopped short of its punchline , a generalized mirth that had no object . 

<root> Quinn was about to say something in response to Auster 's theory , but he was not given the chance . 

<root> Just as he opened his mouth to speak , he was interrupted by a clattering of keys at the front door , the sound of the door opening and then slamming shut , and a burst of voices . 

<root> Auster 's face perked up at the sound . 

<root> He rose from his seat , excused himself to Quinn , and walked quickly towards the door . 

<root> Quinn heard laughter in the hallway , first from a woman and then from a child â€“ the high and the higher , a staccato of ringing shrapnel â€“ and then the basso rumbling of Auster 's guffaw . 

<root> The child spoke : Daddy , look what I found ! 

<root> And then the woman explained that it had been lying on the street , and why not , it seemed perfectly okay . 

<root> A moment later he heard the child running towards him down the hall . The child shot into the living room , caught sight of Quinn , and stopped dead in his tracks . 

<root> He was a blond-haired boy of five or six . 

<root> Good afternoon , said Quinn . 

<root> The boy , rapidly withdrawing into shyness , managed no more than a faint hello . 

<root> In his left hand he held a red object that Quinn could not identify . 

<root> Quinn asked the boy what it was . 

<root> It 's a yoyo , he answered , opening his hand to show him . 

<root> I found it on the street . 

<root> Does it work ? 

<root> The boy gave an exaggerated pantomine shrug . 

<root> Dunno . 

<root> Siri ca n't do it . And I do n't know how . 

<root> Quinn asked him if he could try , and the boy walked over and put it in his hand . 

<root> As he examined the yoyo , he could hear the child breathing beside him , watching his every move . 

<root> The yoyo was plastic , similar to the ones he had played with years ago , but more elaborate somehow , an artifact of the space age . 

<root> Quinn fastened the loop at the end of the string around his middle finger , stood up , and gave it a try . 

<root> The yoyo gave off a fluted , whistling sound as it descended , and sparks shot off inside it . 

<root> The boy gasped , but then the yoyo stopped , dangling at the end of the line . 

<root> A great philosopher once said , muttered Quinn , that the way up and the way down are one and the same . 

<root> But you did n't make it go up , said the boy . 

<root> It only went down . 

<root> You have to keep trying . 

<root> Quinn was rewinding the spool for another attempt when Auster and his wife entered the room . 

<root> He looked up and saw the woman first . 

<root> In that one brief moment he knew that he was in trouble . 

<root> She was a tall , thin blonde , radiantly beautiful , with an energy and happiness that seemed to make everything around her invisible . 

<root> It was too much for Quinn . 

<root> He felt as though Auster were taunting him with the things he had lost , and he responded with envy and rage , a lacerating self-pity . 

<root> Yes , he too would have liked to have this wife and this child , to sit around all day spouting drivel about old books , to be surrounded by yoyos and ham omelettes and fountain pens . 

<root> He prayed to himself for deliverance . 

<root> Auster saw the yoyo in his hands and said , I see you 've already met . 

<root> Daniel , he said to the boy , this is Daniel . 

<root> And then to Quinn , with that same ironic smile , Daniel , this is Daniel . 

<root> The boy burst out laughing and said , Everybody 's Daniel ! 

<root> That 's right , said Quinn . 

<root> I 'm you , and you 're me . 

<root> And around and around it goes , shouted the boy , suddenly spreading his arms and spinning around the room like a gyroscope . 

<root> And this , said Auster , turning to the woman , is my wife , Siri . 

<root> The wife smiled her smile , said she was glad to meet Quinn as though she meant it , and then extended her hand to him . 

<root> He shook it , feeling the uncanny slenderness of her bones , and asked if her name was Norwegian . 

<root> Not many people know that , she said . 

<root> Do you come from Norway ? 

<root> Indirectly , she said . By way of Northfield , Minnesota . 

<root> And then she laughed her laugh , and Quinn felt a little more of himself collapse . 

<root> Quinn was nowhere now . 

<root> He had nothing , he knew nothing , he knew that he knew nothing . 

<root> Not only had he been sent back to the beginning , he was now before the beginning , and so far before the beginning that it was worse than any end he could imagine . 

<root> His watch read nearly six . 

<root> Quinn walked home the way he had come , lengthening his strides with each new block . 

<root> By the time he came to his street , he was running . 

<root> It 's June second , he told himself . 

<root> Try to remember that . 

<root> This is New York , and tomorrow will be June third . 

<root> If all goes well , the following day will be the fourth . 

<root> But nothing is certain . 

<root> The hour had long since passed for his call to Virginia Stillman , and he debated whether to go through with it . 

<root> Would it be possible to ignore her ? 

<root> Could he abandon everything now , just like that ? 

<root> Yes , he said to himself , it was possible . 

<root> He could forget about the case , get back to his routine , write another book . 

<root> He could take a trip if he liked , even leave the country for a while . 

<root> He could go to Paris , for example . 

<root> Yes , that was possible . 

<root> But anywhere would do , he thought , anywhere at all . 

<root> He sat down in his living room and looked at the walls . 

<root> They had once been white , he remembered , but now they had turned a curious shade of yellow . 

<root> Perhaps one day they would drift further into dinginess , lasping into gray , or even brown , like some pieces of aging fruit . 

<root> A white wall becomes a yellow wall becomes a gray wall , he said to himself . 

<root> The paint becomes exhausted , the city encroaches with its soot , the plaster crumbles within . 

<root> Changes , then more changes still . 

<root> He smoked a cigarette , and then another , and then another . 

<root> He looked at his hands , saw that they were dirty , and got up to wash them . 

<root> In the bathroom , with the water running in the sink , he decided to shave as well . 

<root> He lathered his face , took out a clean blade , and started scraping off his beard . 

<root> For some reason , he found it unpleasant to look in the mirror and kept trying to avoid himself with his eyes . 

<root> You 're getting old , he said to himself , you 're turning into an old fart . 

<root> Then he went into the kitchen , ate a bowl of cornflakes , and smoked another cigarette . 

<root> It was seven o'clock now . 

<root> Once again , he debated whether to call Virginia Stillman . 

<root> As he turned the question over in his mind , it occurred to him that he no longer had an opinion . 

<root> He saw the argument for making the call , and at the same time he saw the argument for not making it . 

<root> In the end , it was etiquette that decided . 

<root> It would not be fair to disappear without telling her first . 

<root> After that , it would be perfectly acceptable . 

<root> As long as you tell people what you are going to do , he reasoned , it does n't matter . 

<root> Then you are free to do what you want . 

<root> The number , however , was busy . 

<root> He waited five minutes and dialed again . 

<root> Again , the number was busy . 

<root> For the next hour Quinn alternated between dialing and waiting , always with the same result . 

<root> At last he called the operator and asked whether the phone was out of order . 

<root> There would be a charge of thirty cents , he was told . 

<root> Then came a crackling in the wires , the sound of further dialing , more voices . 

<root> Quinn tried to imagine what the operators looked like . 

<root> Then the first woman spoke again : the number was busy . 

<root> Quinn did not know what to think . 

<root> There were so many possibilities , he could not even begin . 

<root> Stillman ? The phone off the hook ? Someone else altogether ? 

<root> He turned on the television and watched the first two innings of the Mets game . 

<root> Then he dialed once again . 

<root> Same thing . 

<root> In the top of the third St. Louis scored on a walk , a stolen base , an infield out , and a sacrifice fly . 

<root> The Mets matched that run in their half of the inning on a double by Wilson and a single by Youngblood . 

<root> Quinn realized that he did n't care . 

<root> A beer commercial came on , and he turned off the sound . 

<root> For the twentieth time the same thing happened . 

<root> In the top of the fourth St. Louis scored five runs , and Quinn turned off the picture as well . 

<root> He found his red notebook , sat down at his desk , and wrote steadily for the next two hours . 

<root> He did not bother to read over what he had written . 

<root> Then he called Virginia Stillman and got another busy signal . 

<root> He slammed the receiver down so hard that the plastic cracked . 

<root> When he tried to call again , he could no longer get a dial tone . 

<root> He stood up , went into the kitchen , and made another bowl of cornflakes . 

<root> Then he went to bed . 

<root> In his dream , which he later forgot , he found himself walking down Broadway , holding Auster 's son by the hand . 

<root> Security measures are strict on flights to Israel , the bags are searched , the men are frisked , and the women have an electronic hoop passed over them , fore-and-aft . 

<root> Then hand luggage is opened . 

<root> No one is very patient . 

<root> Visibility in the queue is poor because of the many Hasidim with their broad hats and beards and sidelocks and dangling fringes who have descended on Heathrow and are far too restless to wait in line but rush in and out , gesticulating , exclaiming . 

<root> The corridors are jumping with them . 

<root> Some two hundred Hasidim are flying to Israel to attend the circumcision of the firstborn son of their spiritual leader , the Belzer Rabbi . 

<root> Entering the 747 , my wife , Alexandra , and I are enfiladed by eyes that lie dark in hairy ambush . 

<root> To me there is nothing foreign in these hats , side-locks , and fringes . 

<root> It is my childhood revisited . 

<root> At the age of six , I myself wore a tallith katan , or scapular , under my shirt , only mine was a scrap of green calico print , whereas theirs are white linen . 

<root> God instructed Moses to speak to the children of Israel and to " bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments . " 

<root> So they are still wearing them some four thousand years later . 

<root> We find our seats , two in a row of three , toward the rear of the aircraft . 

<root> " Do you speak Yiddish ? " he says . 

<root> " Yes , certainly . " 

<root> " I can not be next to your wife . 

<root> Please sit between us . 

<root> Be so good , " he says . 

<root> " Of course . " 

<root> I take the middle seat , which I dislike , but I am not really put out . 

<root> Curious , rather . 

<root> Our Hasid is in his late twenties . 

<root> He is pimply , his neck is thin , his blue eyes goggle , his underlip extrudes . 

<root> He does not keep a civilized face . 

<root> Thoughts and impulses other than civilized fill it by no means inferior impulses and thoughts . 

<root> And though he is not permitted to sit beside women unrelated to him or to look at them or to communicate with them in any manner ( all of which probably saves him a great deal of trouble ) , he seems a good-hearted young man and he is visibly enjoying himself . 

<root> All the Hasidim are vividly enjoying themselves , dodging through the aisles , visiting chattering standing impatiently in the long lavatory lines , amiable , busy as geese . 

<root> They pay no attention to signs . 

<root> Do n't they understand English ? 

<root> The stewardesses are furious with them . 

<root> I ask one of the hostesses when I may expect to receive a drink and she cries out in irritation , " Back to your seat ! " 

<root> She says this in so ringing a voice that I retreat . 

<root> Not so the merry-minded Hasidim , exulting everywhere . 

<root> The orders given by these young gentile uniformed females are nothing to them . 

<root> To them they are merely attendants , exotic bediener , all but bodyless . 

<root> Anticipating a difficulty , I ask the stewardess to serve me a kosher lunch . 

<root> " I ca n't do that , we have n't enough for them , " she says . 

<root> " We were n't prepared . " 

<root> Her big British eyes are affronted and her bosom has risen with indignation . 

<root> " We 've got to go out of our way to Rome for more of their special meals . " 

<root> Amused , my wife asks why I ordered the kosher lunch . 

<root> " Because when they bring my chicken dinner this kid with the beard will be in a state , " I explain . 

<root> And so he is . 

<root> The British Airways chicken with the chill of death upon it lies before me . 

<root> But after three hours of security exercises at Heathrow I am hungry . 

<root> The young Hasid recoils when the tray is handed to me . 

<root> He addresses me again in Yiddish . 

<root> He says , " I must talk to you . 

<root> You wo n't be offended ? " 

<root> " No , I do n't think so . " 

<root> " You may want to give me a slap in the face . " 

<root> " Why should I ? " 

<root> " You are a Jew . 

<root> You must be a Jew , we are speaking Yiddish . 

<root> How can you eat that ! " 

<root> " It looks awful , does n't it ? " 

<root> " You must n't touch it . 

<root> My womenfolk packed kosher-beef sandwiches for me . 

<root> Is your wife Jewish ? " 

<root> Here I 'm obliged to lie . 

<root> Alexandra is Rumanian . 

<root> But I ca n't give him too many shocks at once , and I say , " She has not had a Jewish upbringing . " 

<root> " She does n't speak Yiddish ? " 

<root> " Not a word . 

<root> But excuse me , I want my lunch . " 

<root> " Will you eat some of my kosher food instead , as a favor ? " 

<root> " With pleasure . " 

<root> " Then I will give you a sandwich , but only on one condition . 

<root> You must never never eat trephena food again . " 

<root> " I ca n't promise you that . 

<root> You 're asking too much . 

<root> And just for one sandwich . " 

<root> " I have a duty toward you , " he tells me . 

<root> " Will you listen to a proposition ? " 

<root> " Of course I will . " 

<root> " So let us make a deal . 

<root> I am prepared to pay you . 

<root> If you will eat nothing but kosher food , for the rest of your life I will send you fifteen dollars a week . " 

<root> " That 's very generous , " I say . 

<root> " Well , you are a Jew , " he says . 

<root> " I must try to save you . " 

<root> " How do you earn your living ? " 

<root> " In a Hasidic sweater factory in New Jersey . 

<root> We are all Hasidim there . 

<root> The boss is a Hasid . 

<root> I came from Israel five years ago to be married in New Jersey . 

<root> My rabbi is in Jerusalem . " 

<root> " How is it that you do n't know English ? " 

<root> " What do I need English for ? 

<root> So , I am asking , will you take my fifteen dollars ? " 

<root> " Kosher food is far more expensive than other kinds , " I say . 

<root> " Fifteen dollars is n't nearly enough . " 

<root> " I can go as far as twenty-five . " 

<root> " I ca n't accept such a sacrifice from you . " 

<root> Shrugging , he gives up and I turn to the twice disagreeable chicken and eat guiltily , my appetite spoiled . 

<root> The young Hasid opens his prayer book . 

<root> " He 's so fervent , " says my wife . 

<root> " I wonder if he 's praying for you . " 

<root> She smiles at my discomfiture . 

<root> As soon as the trays are removed , the Hasidim block the aisles with their Minchah service , rocking themselves and stretching their necks upward . 

<root> This is what has held the Jews together for thousands of years . 

<root> " I like them , " says my wife . 

<root> " They 're so lively , so childlike . " 

<root> " You might find them a little hard to live with , " I tell her . 

<root> " You 'd have to do everything their way , no options given . " 

<root> " But they 're cheerful , and they 're warm and natural . 

<root> I love their costumes . 

<root> Could n't you get one of those beautiful hats ? " 

<root> " I do n't know whether they sell them to outsiders . " 

<root> When the Hasid returns to his seat after prayers , I tell him that my wife , a woman of learning , will be lecturing at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem . 

<root> " What is she ? " 

<root> " A mathematician . " 

<root> He is puzzled . 

<root> " What is that ? " he asks . 

<root> I try to explain . 

<root> He says , " This I never heard of . 

<root> What actually is it they do ? " 

<root> I am astonished . 

<root> I knew that he was an innocent but I would never have believed him to be ignorant of such a thing . 

<root> " So you do n't know what mathematicians are . 

<root> Le Monde gloated over this reversal . 

<root> On July 12 , after the raid , Israel was accused of giving comfort to the reactionaries of Rhodesia and South Africa by its demonstration of military superiority and its use of Western arms and techniques , upsetting the balance between poor and rich countries , disturbing the work of men of good will in Paris who were trying to create a new climate and to treat the countries of the Third World as equals and partners . 

<root> Rhodesians and South Africans , said Le Monde , were toasting the Israelis in champagne . 

<root> But European approval of the raid would endanger the plans of France for a new international order . 

<root> On July 4-5 , again before the rescue , Le Monde had reported without comment wisecracks made by Amin in a speech at Port Louis . 

<root> Addressing the OAS , Amin had provoked laughter and applause among the delegates by saying that the hostages were as comfortable as they could be in the circumstances surrounded by explosives . 

<root> " When I left , " he said , laughing , " the hostages wept and begged me to stay . " 

<root> This broke everybody up . 

<root> We step into the street and my friend David Shahar , whose chest is large , takes a deep breath and advises me to do the same . 

<root> The air , the very air , is thought-nourishing in Jerusalem , the Sages themselves said so . 

<root> I am prepared to believe it . 

<root> I know that it must have special properties . 

<root> The delicacy of the light also affects me . 

<root> I look downward toward the Dead Sea , over broken rocks and small houses with bulbous roofs . 

<root> The color of these is that of the ground itself , and on this strange deadness the melting air presses with an almost human weight . 

<root> Something intelligible , something metaphysical is communicated by these colors . 

<root> The universe interprets itself before your eyes in the openness of the rockjumbled valley ending in dead water . 

<root> Elsewhere you die and disintegrate . 

<root> Here you die and mingle . 

<root> Shahar leads me down from the Mishkenot Sha'ananim , which stands on a slope and faces Mount Zion and the Old City , to the Gai-Hinnom ( Gehenna of tradition ) , where worshipers of Moloch once sacrificed their children . 

<root> He leads me from the Gai-Hinnom up to an ancient Karaite burial ground , where you can see the mingling for yourself . 

<root> It acts queerly on my nerves ( through the feet , as it were ) , because I feel that a good part of this dust must be ground out of human bone . 

<root> I do n't know that Jerusalem is geologically older than other places but the dolomite and clay look hoarier than anything I ever saw . 

<root> Gray and sunken , in the thoughts of Mr Bloom in Joyce 's Ulysses . 

<root> But there is nothing in the brilliant air and the massive white clouds hanging over the crumpled mountains that suggests exhaustion . 

<root> This atmosphere makes the American commonplace " out of this world " true enough to give your soul a start . 

<root> The municipality has turned the Gai-Hinnom into a park . 

<root> The Wolfson Foundation of London has paid for the planting of gardens , and Arab kids are kicking a soccer ball in the green bottom of the valley . 

<root> East Jerusalem toughies of fourteen are smoking cigarettes and stiffening their shoulders , practicing the dangerous-loiterer bit as we pass . 

<root> Shahar is bald , muscular , and his shirt is ornamented with nags , horseshoes , and bridles , a yellow print on dark blue . 

<root> Amusing , since he 's a writer and a thoughtful man , anything but a tout . 

<root> So we look into ancient tombed caverns and the niches into which corpses once were laid . 

<root> Now truck fenders are rusting there , the twentieth century adding its crumbling metal to the great Jerusalem dust mixture . 

<root> You can be absolutely sure , says Shahar , that the Prophet Jeremiah passed this way . 

<root> Right where we are standing . 

<root> I find in Elie Kedourie 's Arabic Political Memoirs facts unknown to most about American diplomacy in the late forties . 

<root> Certainly I did n't know them . 

<root> In the Middle East and probably elsewhere , the United States relied heavily on management consultants and public-relations experts . 

<root> The American firm of Booz , Allen &amp; Hamilton lent one of its specialists , Miles Copeland by name , to the State Department , where he was in 1955 a member of a group called the Middle East Policy Planning Committee , the main purpose of which was , in his own words , " to work out ways of taking advantage of the friendship which was developing between ourselves and Nasser . " 

<root> In 1947 Copeland had been sent to Damascus ( " by whom is not stated , " Kedourie says ) " to make unofficial contact " with Syrian leaders and " to probe for means of persuading them , on their own , to liberalize their political system . " 

<root> Spreading democracy over the world , the Americans first fought rigged elections in Syria , but the old corruption continued despite all their power and money could do . 

<root> Frustrated , the Americans decided for the best of reasons , as always , to make a heavier move : 

<root> " The American Minister at Damascus decided to encourage a military coup-d'etat , so that Syria might enjoy democracy , " Kedourie writes . 

<root> This was not considered particularly bizarre ; other American ambassadors and ministers in the Arab world were entirely in favor of " genuine " revolution to overthrow old landowners , rich crooks , and politicians . 

<root> " What was wanted was an elite to underpin the rulers , themselves in turn supported and buttressed by a population which presumably understood , approved , and legitimated the aims of such an elite . 

<root> Whoever knows the Middle East will agree that such a quest was the political equivalent of the search for the philosophical stone . " 

<root> Failing in Syria , the Americans went to work in Egypt . 

<root> Kermit Roosevelt of the CIA " met a number of officers who were involved in the conspiracy which led to the coup-d'etat of 22 July , 1952 . " 

<root> The Americans wanted the new regime to make the populace literate , to create " a large and stable middle class a sufficient identification of local ideals and values , so that truly indigenous democratic institutions could grow up . " 

<root> Gliding into a new political realm , the Americans arranged for loans to the Egyptian government . 

<root> They believed that genuine democracy was now on its way . 

<root> James Eichelberger , a State Department political scientist who had been an account executive for J Walter Thompson , one of the world 's largest advertising and public-relations firms , " was sent to Cairo where he talked with Nasser and his confidants and produced a series of papers identifying the new government 's problems and recommending policies to deal with them . " 

<root> One of these papers , written by Eichelberger himself , was translated into Arabic , " commented upon by members of Nasser 's staff , translated back into English for Eichelberger 's benefit . " 

<root> This document , called " Power Problems of a Revolutionary Government , " went back-and-forth , according to Mr Copeland , " between English and Arabic until a final version was produced . 

<root> The final paper was passed off to the outside world as the work of Zakaria Mohieddin , Nasser 's most thoughtful ( in Western eyes ) , reasonable deputy , and accepted at face value by intelligence analysts of the State Department , the C.I.A. and , presumably , similar agencies of other governments . " 

<root> Who would have thought that a former American account executive could write : 

<root> " The police should be politisized , and should become , to whatever extent necessary , a partisan paramilitary arm of the revolutionary government " ? 

<root> This is Leninism , neat , with neither ice nor bitters . 

<root> Or , " The nerve center of the whole security system of a revolutionary state ( or of any state ) lies in a secret body , the identity and very existence of which can be safely known only to the head of the revolutionary government and to the fewest possible number of other key leaders . " 

<root> It was Jefferson who said that the tree of liberty must occasionally be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants . 

<root> We must now believe that the same romantic conviction has been alive somewhere in the offices of J Walter Thompson . 

<root> The United States is , after all , the prime revolutionary country . 

<root> Or was Mr Eichelberger simply an executive with a client to please and a job to do a pure professional ? 

<root> Or is there in the world by now a natural understanding of revolution , of mass organization , cadres , police rule , and secret executive bodies ? 

<root> This is a shocking suspicion . 

<root> Of course the paper written by Mr Eichelberger and his Egyptian collaborators states that the purpose of the Nasser seizure of power was " to solve the pressing social and political problems which made the revolution necessary . " 

<root> To solve problems , to help , to befriend , to increase freedom . 

<root> To strengthen America 's position , and at the same time to do good ; 

<root> to advance the cause of universal equality ; 

<root> to be the illusionless tough guy on a world scale ; 

<root> to be a mover and shaker , a shaper of destiny or perhaps , surrendering to fantasies of omnipotence , to be the nation-making American plenipotentiary , at work behind the scenes and playing confidently even with Bolshevik fire . 

<root> And what problems were solved ? 

<root> Nasser solved no problems . 

<root> Mr Kedourie doubts that he needed " to call on the resources of American political science for such lessons in tyranny ? 

<root> What does remain most puzzling , " he says , " is why it was thought that the imparting of such lessons could advance the interests of the United States , or even contribute to the welfare of the Egyptian people . " 

<root> For an American , the most intriguing question is this : 

<root> Whence the passion for social theory among these high functionaries of the advertising world ? 

<root> How did executive types ever learn of such things ? 

<root> Reading The Sound and the Fury last night , I came upon words in Compson 's thought that belonged to E E Cummings and the thirties , not to the year 1910 . 

<root> " Land of the kike home of the wop , " says Compson to himself when he buys a bun from a small Italian girl . 

<root> This I would have read without flinching in Chicago but in Jerusalem I flinched and put the book down . 

<root> Returning to it next day , I found Faulkner guilty of no offense . 

<root> It 's possible that people at the turn of the century were saying " land of the kike " and that Faulkner did n't borrow it from Cummings . 

<root> I had been telling Shahar when we were walking in the Gai-Hinnom that I had n't liked it when David Ben-Gurion on his visits to the United States would call upon American Jews to give up their illusions about goyish democracy and emigrate full speed to Israel . 

<root> As if America 's two-hundred-year record of liberal democracy signified nothing . 

<root> If Israel were governed as Egypt is , or Syria , would I have come here at all ? 

<root> But then , to its more severe leftist critics , some of them Jews , Israel is not the " democratic exception " it is said to be . 

<root> The New Left sees it as a reactionary small country . 

<root> Its detractors tell you how it abuses its Arab population and , to a lesser extent , Jewish immigrants from North Africa and the Orient . 

<root> It is occasionally denounced by some Israelis as corrupt , " Levantine , " theocratic . 

<root> Gossip traces the worst of the Israeli financial swindles to the most observant of Orthodox Jews . 

<root> I am often told that the old Ashkenazi leaders were unimaginative , that the new Rabin group lacks stature , that Ben-Gurion was a terrible old guy but a true leader , that the younger generation is hostile to North African and Asian Jews . 

<root> These North African and Oriental immigrants are blamed for bringing a baksheesh mentality to Israel ; the intellectuals are blamed for letting the quality of life ( a deplorable phrase ) deteriorate . 

<root> " We came here to build a just society . 

<root> And what happened immediately ? " 

<root> I speak of this to Shahar . 

<root> He says to me , " Where there is no paradox there is no life . " 

<root> In Jakov Lind 's interesting brief book on Israel , Ben-Gurion is quoted as saying , " The Jews know hardly anything of a hell that might await them . 

<root> Their hell is a personal dissatisfaction with themselves if they are mediocre . " 

<root> Jews do , it is well known , make inordinate demands upon themselves and upon one another . 

<root> Upon the world , too . 

<root> I occasionally wonder whether that is why the world is so uncomfortable with them . 

<root> At times I suspect that the world would be glad to see the last of its Christianity , and that it is the persistency of the Jews that prevents it . 

<root> I say this remembering that Jacques Maritain once characterized European anti-Semitism of the twentieth century as an attempt to get rid of the moral burden of Christianity . 

<root> And what is it that has led the Jews to place themselves , after the greatest disaster of their history , in a danger zone ? 

<root> " Would n't it be the most horrible of ironies if the Jews had collected themselves conveniently in one country for a second Holocaust ? " 

<root> This is a thought that sometimes crosses Jewish minds . 

<root> It is accompanied by the further reflection ( partly proud , mostly bitter ) that we Jews seem to have a genius for finding the heart of the crisis . 

<root> The Valley of Jehosaphat , with its tombs . 

<root> A narrow road , and on the slopes acres and acres of stone . 

<root> Caves , graves , litter , fallen rocks , and in tiny schoolrooms Arab boys singing their lessons . 

<root> Even in November the place is uncomfortably warm . 

<root> The Jordanians built a road over Jewish graves . 

<root> The municipality of Jerusalem is planning to build a new road and will tear the Jordanian one up . 

<root> The Herodian relics are all that relics should be columns distorted , well worked over by time , Absalom 's tomb with its bulbous roof and odd funnel tapering out of it . 

<root> The armies of the dead in all directions , interminable . 

<root> A fine thing to obsess yourself with , burial and lamentation and lying about under the walls of Jerusalem waiting for the Messiah 's trumpet to sound . 

<root> a few Arab hens are scratching up dust and pecking . 

<root> Not a breakfast egg comes to the table that is n't death-speckled . 

<root> Parties of American girls come down the slope in their dungarees , with sweaters tied by their sleeves about the waist . 

<root> Above , to the left , a Muslim cemetery . 

<root> Everything reflects the significant event , for the significant event is beyond question historical and political , not private . 

<root> She thinks that it is sly of me to deny this . 

<root> Not to submit to what societies and governments consider to be important . 

<root> Stendhal 's heroes , when they are in prison , choose to think above love . 

<root> E E Cummings , locked up by the French government , finds his aesthetic paradise in the detention camp of Ferte Mace . 

<root> The bravest of modern writers are the Mandelstams and the Sinyavskys . 

<root> Before he died of cold , hunger , and exhaustion in Siberia , Osip Mandelstam recited his poems to other convicts , at their request . 

<root> Andrei Sinyavsky , in his prison journal , concentrates on art . 

<root> Perhaps to remain a poet in such circumstances is also to reach the heart of politics . 

<root> Then human feelings , human experience , the human form and face , recover their proper place the foreground . 

<root> My friend John Auerbach comes up from Caesarea to see me . 

<root> A kibbutznik seaman , he has just returned from a voyage . 

<root> I have known him for only a few years but he has become a dear friend . 

<root> I had been warned that as I grew older the difficulty of forming new friendships would be great . 

<root> On the contrary , I find it much easier now at sixty to draw near to people . 

<root> John looks too much the writer slight in person , delicate to be a chief engineer . 

<root> He does , however , hold an engineer 's ticket and can do complicated emergency repairs in mid-ocean . 

<root> Boyish , bearded ( the beard is short and copper-brown ) , nervous , a bit high , thinner than when I saw him last , he carries a cardboard valise containing books and booze and pyjamas and a house present . 

<root> He is delighted to be here , and he is suffering the one activates the other . 

<root> He is grieving for his son . 

<root> Adam Auerbach served in an electronic-warfare unit and was returning from a military action when the helicopter in which he was flying crashed . 

<root> We embrace and then we go out of doors with a bottle to have a drink and get some sun . 

<root> Even on a sunny morning the stone buildings of Jerusalem chill your hands and feet . 

<root> Stepping out , I feel a bit numb , like a wasp in autumn . 

<root> We sit on a stone wall over the garden and drink aquavit . 

<root> He wants to talk . 

<root> He loves books passionately , he wants to discuss American literature , to hear marvelous things from me . 

<root> But I can see that the big current of his suffering has begun to run heavily . 

<root> He has returned from a voyage , he is out in the sun shining from the hills of Moab , he is drinking aquavit with a dear friend , looking over at Mount Zion . 

<root> But his son is dead . 

<root> At sixteen John escaped from the Warsaw ghetto , leaving behind his parents and his sister . 

<root> They were killed . 

<root> Everyone was killed . 

<root> John somehow obtained Polish seaman 's papers , and for several years he worked in the engine rooms of German freighters . 

<root> When the war ended he came to Israel via Cyprus , joined Kibbutz Sdot Yam , married , and had two children . 

<root> His first wife died of cancer about ten years ago and he has married again . 

<root> He says , " I ask myself in what ways my life has not been typical . 

<root> For a Jew from Eastern Europe it has been completely typical war , death of mother , death of father , death of sister , four years in disguise among the Germans , death of wife , death of son . 

<root> Thirty years of hard work , planting and harvesting in the kibbutz . 

<root> Nothing exceptional . " 

<root> John sails infrequently now . 

<root> He does n't like the new huge tankers . 

<root> Supermechanized , ultraefficient , they give the crew no time in foreign ports . 

<root> The cargo on the voyage from which he has just returned was Dead Sea potash . 

<root> They were to bring home Italian steel . 

<root> North of Naples they had bad weather and engine trouble , but they reached their harbor and anchored near two Japanese ships . 

<root> On the pilot 's advice they were moved farther into port by two tugs . 

<root> Within five hours John had repaired the engines , but the port officials claimed that the ship was incapacitated and demanded that the captain post a twenty-thousand-dollar bond against expenses that might be run up by his " crippled ship . " 

<root> True , the ship had had to be moved into its berth by the tugs but it had been crippled only briefly . 

<root> Well , this matter was in dispute . 

<root> The ship lay unloaded and demurrage fees mounted in brief , a holdup by local racketeers . 

<root> The same everywhere , now . 

<root> Everybody has some con going , says John , who loves American slang . 

<root> The home office in Haifa was trying to get protection from the insurance company . 

<root> There were long days in port with nothing to do . 

<root> The town was covered in potash dust . 

<root> Waiters and bartenders wiped dishes and glasses continually . 

<root> Brushing at dust was the commonest gesture in town . 

<root> A community of about twenty thousand people had traffic jams worthy of Rome , cars as a matter of course rushing into the reserved bus lanes , screwing everything up and honking madly . 

<root> It all came to a panting standstill morning and evening without fail . 

<root> To get away from the traffic snarl you could climb a nearby mountain and come down to a deserted beach , similar to the beach at Sdot Yam . 

<root> John and his dog , Mississippi , went there every day . 

<root> The German tourists had gone home , the bathing cabins were nailed shut . 

<root> It was lovely , the small waves coming in steadily . 

<root> In little pangs , said John . 

<root> Part of the American Sixth Fleet was anchored nearby . 

<root> The aircraft carrier John F Kennedy , with its helicopters , reminded John of the death of his son . 

<root> On shore leave they wear civilian clothing now . 

<root> This probably makes them less rowdy . 

<root> One of the boys was from Oklahoma , near Tulsa . 

<root> He had heard of Israel , but only just , and he was not especially interested . 

<root> John was delighted by this . 

<root> A clean young soul , he said . 

<root> Such ignorance was refreshing . 

<root> The young sailor knew nothing about holocausts or tanks in the desert or terrorist bombs . 

<root> Back at sea , John had to stand double watches in the engine room because he was shorthanded . 

<root> Off duty , he read in his cabin and chatted with his confidante , Mississippi . 

<root> The crew said he was drinking himself silly in his quarters . 

<root> When the ship passed Stromboli at night , there was a streak of crimson lava flowing from the volcano and the sailors would n't leave the television set to look at this natural phenomenon . 

<root> But an owl from the island , disturbed by the sparks , flew out to the ship and was discovered next day on the mast . 

<root> One of the young sailors carried it down . 

<root> Then an engine man from the Balkans said , " In our village we nailed owls to the church door when we caught them . " 

<root> They shut the owl in the paint locker while they debated what to do with it , and in the night John set it free . 

<root> The bird scratched his arm rather badly . 

<root> " Go back to Stromboli , you dumb bastard , " he said . 

<root> So it flew off and the ship continued on its foul way . 

<root> It 's the water pumped into the tanks for ballast and then pumped out again that pollutes the seas , says John . 

<root> Before I left Chicago , the art critic Harold Rosenberg said to me , " Going to Jerusalem ? 

<root> And wondering whether people will talk freely ? 

<root> You 've got to be kidding , they 'll talk your head off . " 

<root> He spoke as a Jew to a Jew about Jewish powers of speech . 

<root> In flight , if the door of your plane comes open you are sucked into space . 

<root> Here in Jerusalem , when you shut your apartment door behind you you fall into a gale of conversation exposition , argument , harangue , analysis , theory , expostulation , threat , and prophecy . 

<root> From diplomats you hear cagey explanations ; 

<root> from responsible persons , cautious and grudging statements rephrasing and amending your own questions ; 

<root> from parents and children , deadly divisions ; 

<root> from friends who let themselves go , passionate speeches , raging denunciation of Western Europe , of Russia , of America . 

<root> I listen carefully , closely , more closely than I 've ever listened in my life , utterly attentive , but I often feel that I have dropped into a shoreless sea . 

<root> The subject of all this talk is , ultimately , survival the survival of the decent society created in Israel within a few decades . 

<root> At first this is hard to grasp because the setting is so civilized . 

<root> You are in a city like many another well , not quite , for Jerusalem is the only ancient city I 've ever seen whose antiquities are not on display as relics but are in daily use . 

<root> Still , the city is a modern city with modern utilities . 

<root> You shop in supermarkets , you say good morning to friends on the telephone , you hear symphony orchestras on the radio . 

<root> But suddenly the music stops and a terrorist bomb is reported . 

<root> A new explosion outside a coffee shop on the Jaffa Road : six young people killed and thirty-eight more wounded . 

<root> Uneasy , you go out to your civilized dinner . 

<root> Bombs are exploding everywhere . 

<root> Dynamite has just been thrown in London ; 

<root> the difference is that when a bomb goes off in a West End restaurant the fundamental right of England to exist is not in dispute . 

<root> Yet here you sit at dinner with charming people in a dining room like any other . 

<root> You know that your hostess has lost a son ; that her sister lost children in the 1973 war ; 

<root> That in this Jerusalem street , coolly sweet with night flowers and dark green under the lamps , many other families have lost children . 

<root> And on the Jaffa Road , because of another bomb , six adolescents two on a break from night school stopping at a coffee shop to eat buns , have just died . 

<root> But in the domestic ceremony of passed dishes and filled glasses thoughts of a destructive enemy are hard to grasp . 

<root> What you do know is that there is one fact of Jewish life unchanged by the creation of a Jewish state : you can not take your right to live for granted . 

<root> Others can ; you can not . 

<root> This is not to say that everyone else is living pleasantly and well under a decent regime . 

<root> No , it means only that the Jews , because they are Jews , have never been able to take the right to live as a natural right . 

<root> To be sure , many Israelis refuse to admit that this historic uneasiness has not been eliminated . 

<root> They seem to think of themselves as a fixed power , immovable . 

<root> Their point has been made . 

<root> The Nellie , a cruising yawl , swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails , and was at rest . 

<root> The flood had made , the wind was nearly calm , and being bound down the river , the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide . 

<root> The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway . 

<root> In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint , and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked , with gleams of varnished sprits . 

<root> A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness . 

<root> The air was dark above Gravesend , and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom , brooding motionless over the biggest , and the greatest , town on earth . 

<root> The Director of Companies was our captain and our host . 

<root> We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward . 

<root> On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical . 

<root> He resembled a pilot , which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified . 

<root> It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary , but behind him , within the brooding gloom . 

<root> Between us there was , as I have already said somewhere , the bond of the sea . 

<root> Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation , it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other 's yarns â€“ and even convictions . 

<root> The Lawyer â€“ the best of old fellows â€“ had , because of his many years and many virtues , the only cushion on deck , and was lying on the only rug . 

<root> The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes , and was toying architecturally with the bones . 

<root> Marlow sat cross-legged right aft , leaning against the mizzen-mast . 

<root> He had sunken cheeks , a yellow complexion , a straight back , an ascetic aspect , and , with his arms dropped , the palms of hands outwards , resembled an idol . 

<root> The Director , satisfied the anchor had good hold , made his way aft and sat down amongst us . 

<root> We exchanged a few words lazily . 

<root> Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht . 

<root> For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes . 

<root> We felt meditative , and fit for nothing but placid staring . 

<root> The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance . 

<root> The water shone pacifically ; the sky , without a speck , was a benign immensity of unstained light ; the very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric , hung from the wooded rises inland , and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds . 

<root> Only the gloom to the west , brooding over the upper reaches , became more somber every minute , as if angered by the approach of the sun . 

<root> And at last , in its curved and imperceptible fall , the sun sank low , and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat , as if about to go out suddenly , stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men . 

<root> Forthwith a change came over the waters , and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound . 

<root> The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day , after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks , spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth . 

<root> We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever , but in the august light of abiding memories . 

<root> And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has , as the phrase goes , followed the sea with reverence and affection , than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames . 

<root> The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service , crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea . 

<root> It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud , from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin , knights all , titled and untitled â€“ the great knights-errant of the sea . 

<root> It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time , from the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure , to be visited by the Queen 's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale , to the Erebus and Terror , bound on other conquests â€“ and that never returned . 

<root> It had known the ships and the men . 

<root> They had sailed from Deptford , from Greenwich , from Erith â€“ the adventurers and the settlers ; kings ' ships and the ships of men on Change ; captains , admirals , the dark " interlopers " of the Eastern trade , and the commissioned " generals " of East India fleets . 

<root> Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame , they all had gone out on that stream , bearing the sword , and often the torch , messengers of the might within the land , bearers of a spark from the sacred fire . 

<root> What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth ! ... 

<root> The dreams of men , the seed of commonwealths , the germs of empires . 

<root> The sun set ; the dusk fell on the stream , and lights began to appear along the shore . 

<root> The Chapman lighthouse , a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat , shone strongly . 

<root> Lights of ships moved in the fairway â€“ a great stir of lights going up and going down . And farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky , a brooding gloom in sunshine , a lurid glare under the stars . 

<root> And this also , said Marlow suddenly , has been one of the dark places of the earth . 

<root> He was the only man of us who still followed the sea . 

<root> The worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class . 

<root> He was a seaman , but he was a wanderer , too , while most seamen lead , if one may so express it , a sedentary life . 

<root> Their minds are of the stay-at-home order , and their home is always with them â€“ the ship ; and so is their country â€“ the sea . 

<root> One ship is very much like another , and the sea is always the same . 

<root> In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores , the foreign faces , the changing immensity of life , glide past , veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance ; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself , which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny . 

<root> For the rest , after his hours of work , a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent , and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing . 

<root> The yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity , the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut . 

<root> But Marlow was not typical ( if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted ) , and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside , enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze , in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine . 

<root> His remark did not seem at all surprising . 

<root> It was just like Marlow . It was accepted in silence . 

<root> No one took the trouble to grunt even ; and presently he said , very slow â€“ 

<root> I was thinking of very old times , when the Romans first came here , nineteen hundred years ago â€“ the other day ... . 

<root> Light came out of this river since â€“ you say Knights ? 

<root> Yes ; but it is like a running blaze on a plain , like a flash of lightning in the clouds . 

<root> We live in the flicker â€“ may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling ! 

<root> But darkness was here yesterday . 

<root> Imagine the feelings of a commander of a fine â€“ what 'd 'ye call 'em ? â€“ trireme in the Mediterranean , ordered suddenly to the north ; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry ; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries , â€“ a wonderful lot of handy men they must have been too â€“ used to build , apparently by the hundred , in a month or two , if we may believe what we read . 

<root> Imagine him here â€“ the very end of the world , a sea the color of lead , a sky the color of smoke , a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina â€“ and going up this river with stores , or orders , or what you like . 

<root> Sandbanks , marshes , forests , savages , â€“ precious little to eat fit for a civilized man , nothing but Thames water to drink . 

<root> No Falernian wine here , no going ashore . 

<root> Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness , like a needle in a bundle of hay â€“ cold , fog , tempests , disease , exile , and death , â€“ death skulking in the air , in the water , in the bush . 

<root> They must have been dying like flies here . 

<root> Oh yes â€“ he did it . 

<root> Did it very well , too , no doubt , and without thinking much about it either , except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time , perhaps . 

<root> They were men enough to face the darkness . 

<root> And perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna by-and-by , if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful climate . 

<root> Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga â€“ perhaps too much dice , you know â€“ coming out here in the train of some prefect , or tax-gatherer , or trader even , to mend his fortunes . 

<root> Land in a swamp , march through the woods , and in some inland post feel the savagery , the utter savagery , had closed round him , â€“ all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest , in the jungles , in the hearts of wild men . 

<root> There 's no initiation either into such mysteries . 

<root> He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible , which is also detestable . 

<root> And it has a fascination , too , that goes to work upon him . 

<root> The fascination of the abomination â€“ you know . 

<root> Imagine the growing regrets , the longing to escape , the powerless disgust , the surrender , the hate . 

<root> He paused . 

<root> Mind , he began again , lifting one arm from the elbow , the palm of the hand outwards , so that , with his legs folded before him , he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower â€“ Mind , none of us would feel exactly like this . 

<root> What saves us is efficiency â€“ the devotion to efficiency . 

<root> But these chaps were not much account , really . 

<root> They were no colonists ; their administration was merely a squeeze , and nothing more , I suspect . 

<root> They were conquerors , and for that you want only brute force â€“ nothing to boast of , when you have it , since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others . 

<root> They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got . 

<root> It was just robbery with violence , aggravated murder on a great scale , and men going at it blind â€“ as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness . 

<root> The conquest of the earth , which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves , is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much . 

<root> What redeems it is the idea only . 

<root> An idea at the back of it ; not a sentimental pretense but an idea ; and an unselfish belief in the idea â€“ something you can set up , and bow down before , and offer a sacrifice to ... . 

<root> He broke off . 

<root> Flames glided in the river , small green flames , red flames , white flames , pursuing , overtaking , joining , crossing each other â€“ then separating slowly or hastily . 

<root> The traffic of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river . 

<root> We looked on , waiting patiently â€“ there was nothing else to do till the end of the flood ; but it was only after a long silence , when he said , in a hesitating voice , I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit , that we knew we were fated , before the ebb began to run , to hear about one of Marlow 's inconclusive experiences . 

<root> I do n't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally he began , showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to hear ; 

<root> yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I got out there , what I saw , how I went up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap . 

<root> It was the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience . 

<root> It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me â€“ and into my thoughts . 

<root> It was somber enough too â€“ and pitiful â€“ not extraordinary in any way â€“ not very clear either . 

<root> No , not very clear . 

<root> And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light . 

<root> I had then , as you remember , just returned to London after a lot of Indian Ocean , Pacific , China Seas â€“ a regular dose of the East â€“ six years or so , and I was loafing about , hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes , just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you . 

<root> It was very fine for a time , but after a bit I did get tired of resting . 

<root> Then I began to look for a ship â€“ I should think the hardest work on earth . 

<root> But the ships would n't even look at me . 

<root> And I got tired of that game too . 

<root> Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps . 

<root> I would look for hours at South America , or Africa , or Australia , and lose myself in all the glories of exploration . 

<root> At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth , and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map ( but they all look that ) I would put my finger on it and say , ' When I grow up I will go there . ' 

<root> The North Pole was one of these places , I remember . 

<root> Well , I have n't been there yet , and shall not try now . 

<root> The glamour 's off . 

<root> Other places were scattered about the Equator , and in every sort of latitude all over the two hemispheres . 

<root> I have been in some of them , and ... well , we wo n't talk about that . 

<root> But there was one yet â€“ the biggest , the most blank , so to speak â€“ that I had a hankering after . 

<root> True , by this time it was not a blank space any more . 

<root> It had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names . 

<root> It had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery â€“ a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over . 

<root> It had become a place of darkness . 

<root> But there was in it one river especially , a mighty big river , that you could see on the map , resembling an immense snake uncoiled , with its head in the sea , its body at rest curving afar over a vast country , and its tail lost in the depths of the land . 

<root> And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window , it fascinated me as a snake would a bird â€“ a silly little bird . 

<root> Then I remembered there was a big concern , a Company for trade on that river . 

<root> Dash it all ! I thought to myself , they ca n't trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water â€“ steamboats ! 

<root> Why should n't I try to get charge of one ? 

<root> I went on along Fleet Street , but could not shake off the idea . 

<root> The snake had charmed me . 

<root> You understand it was a Continental concern , that Trading society ; but I have a lot of relations living on the Continent , because it 's cheap and not so nasty as it looks , they say . 

<root> I ventured to hint that the Company was run for profit . 

<root> You forget , dear Charlie , that the laborer is worthy of his hire , she said , brightly . 

<root> It 's queer how out of touch with truth women are . 

<root> They live in a world of their own , and there had never been anything like it , and never can be . 

<root> It is too beautiful altogether , and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset . 

<root> Some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over . 

<root> After this I got embraced , told to wear flannel , be sure to write often , and so on â€“ and I left . 

<root> In the street â€“ I do n't know why â€“ a queer feeling came to me that I was an impostor . 

<root> Odd thing that I , who used to clear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours ' notice , with less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street , had a moment â€“ I wo n't say of hesitation , but of startled pause , before this commonplace affair . 

<root> The best way I can explain it to you is by saying that , for a second or two , I felt as though , instead of going to the center of a continent , I were about to set off for the center of the earth . 

<root> I left in a French steamer , and she called in every blamed port they have out there , for , as far as I could see , the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-house officers . 

<root> I watched the coast . 

<root> Watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma . 

<root> There it is before you â€“ smiling , frowning , inviting , grand , mean , insipid , or savage , and always mute with an air of whispering , ' Come and find out . 

<root> ' This one was almost featureless , as if still in the making , with an aspect of monotonous grimness . 

<root> The edge of a colossal jungle , so dark-green as to be almost black , fringed with white surf , ran straight , like a ruled line , far , far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist . 

<root> The sun was fierce , the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam . 

<root> Here and there grayish-whitish specks showed up , clustered inside the white surf , with a flag flying above them perhaps . 

<root> Settlements some centuries old , and still no bigger than pin-heads on the untouched expanse of their background . 

<root> We pounded along , stopped , landed soldiers ; went on , landed custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness , with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in it ; landed more soldiers â€“ to take care of the custom-house clerks , presumably . 

<root> Some , I heard , got drowned in the surf ; but whether they did or not , nobody seemed particularly to care . 

<root> They were just flung out there , and on we went . 

<root> Every day the coast looked the same , as though we had not moved ; but we passed various places â€“ trading places â€“ with names like Gran' Bassam Little Popo , names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth . 

<root> The idleness of a passenger , my isolation amongst all these men with whom I had no point of contact , the oily and languid sea , the uniform somberness of the coast , seemed to keep me away from the truth of things , within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion . 

<root> The voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure , like the speech of a brother . 

<root> It was something natural , that had its reason , that had a meaning . 

<root> Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality . 

<root> It was paddled by black fellows . 

<root> You could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening . 

<root> They shouted , sang ; their bodies streamed with perspiration ; they had faces like grotesque masks â€“ these chaps ; but they had bone , muscle , a wild vitality , an intense energy of movement , that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast . 

<root> They wanted no excuse for being there . They were a great comfort to look at . 

<root> For a time I would feel I belonged still to a world of straightforward facts ; but the feeling would not last long . 

<root> Something would turn up to scare it away . 

<root> Once , I remember , we came upon a man-of-war anchored off the coast . 

<root> There was n't even a shed there , and she was shelling the bush . 

<root> It appears the French had one of their wars going on thereabouts . 

<root> Her ensign dropped limp like a rag ; the muzzles of the long eight-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull ; the greasy , slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down , swaying her thin masts . 

<root> In the empty immensity of earth , sky , and water , there she was , incomprehensible , firing into a continent . 

<root> Pop , would go one of the eight-inch guns ; a small flame would dart and vanish , a little white smoke would disappear , a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech â€“ and nothing happened . 

<root> Nothing could happen . 

<root> There was a touch of insanity in the proceeding , a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight ; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives â€“ he called them enemies ! â€“ hidden out of sight somewhere . 

<root> We gave her her letters ( I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day ) and went on . 

<root> We called at some more places with farcical names , where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb ; all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf , as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders ; in and out of rivers , streams of death in life , whose banks were rotting into mud , whose waters , thickened into slime , invaded the contorted mangroves , that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair . 

<root> Nowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularized impression , but the general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me . 

<root> It was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares . 

<root> It was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth of the big river . 

<root> We anchored off the seat of the government . 

<root> But my work would not begin till some two hundred miles farther on . So as soon as I could I made a start for a place thirty miles higher up . 

<root> I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer . 

<root> Her captain was a Swede , and knowing me for a seaman , invited me on the bridge . 

<root> He was a young man , lean , fair , and morose , with lanky hair and a shuffling gait . 

<root> As we left the miserable little wharf , he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore . 

<root> Been living there ? he asked . 

<root> I said , Yes . 

<root> Fine lot these government chaps â€“ are they not ? he went on , speaking English with great precision and considerable bitterness . 

<root> It is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month . 

<root> I wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up country ? 

<root> I said to him I expected to see that soon . 

<root> So-o-o ! he exclaimed . 

<root> He shuffled athwart , keeping one eye ahead vigilantly . 

<root> Do n't be too sure , he continued . 

<root> The other day I took up a man who hanged himself on the road . 

<root> He was a Swede , too . 

<root> Hanged himself ! 

<root> Why , in God 's name ? I cried . 

<root> He kept on looking out watchfully . 

<root> Who knows ? 

<root> The sun too much for him , or the country perhaps . 

<root> At last we opened a reach . 

<root> A rocky cliff appeared , mounds of turned-up earth by the shore , houses on a hill , others , with iron roofs , amongst a waste of excavations , or hanging to the declivity . 

<root> A continuous noise of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation . 

<root> A lot of people , mostly black and naked , moved about like ants . 

<root> A jetty projected into the river . 

<root> A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare . 

<root> There 's your Company 's station , said the Swede , pointing to three wooden barrack-like structures on the rocky slope . 

<root> ' I will send your things up . 

<root> Four boxes did you say ? 

<root> So . Farewell . 

<root> ' I came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass , then found a path leading up the hill . 

<root> It turned aside for the bowlders , and also for an undersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air . 

<root> One was off . 

<root> The thing looked as dead as the carcass of some animal . 

<root> I came upon more pieces of decaying machinery , a stack of rusty rails . 

<root> To the left a clump of trees made a shady spot , where dark things seemed to stir feebly . 

<root> I blinked , the path was steep . 

<root> A horn tooted to the right , and I saw the black people run . A heavy and dull detonation shook the ground , a puff of smoke came out of the cliff , and that was all . 

<root> No change appeared on the face of the rock . 

<root> They were building a railway . 

<root> The cliff was not in the way or anything ; but this objectless blasting was all the work going on . 

<root> A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head . 

<root> Six black men advanced in a file , toiling up the path . They walked erect and slow , balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads , and the clink kept time with their footsteps . 

<root> Black rags were wound round their loins , and the short ends behind wagged to and fro like tails . 

<root> I could see every rib , the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope ; each had an iron collar on his neck , and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them , rhythmically clinking . 

<root> Another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war I had seen firing into a continent . 

<root> It was the same kind of ominous voice ; but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies . 

<root> They were called criminals , and the outraged law , like the bursting shells , had come to them , an insoluble mystery from over the sea . 

<root> All their meager breasts panted together , the violently dilated nostrils quivered , the eyes stared stonily uphill . 

<root> They passed me within six inches , without a glance , with that complete , deathlike indifference of unhappy savages . 

<root> Behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed , the product of the new forces at work , strolled despondently , carrying a rifle by its middle . 

<root> He had a uniform jacket with one button off , and seeing a white man on the path , hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity . 

<root> This was simple prudence , white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who I might be . 

<root> He was speedily reassured , and with a large , white , rascally grin , and a glance at his charge , seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted trust . 

<root> After all , I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings . 

<root> Instead of going up , I turned and descended to the left . 

<root> My idea was to let that chain-gang get out of sight before I climbed the hill . 

<root> You know I am not particularly tender ; 

<root> I 've had to strike and to fend off . I 've had to resist and to attack sometimes â€“ that 's only one way of resisting â€“ without counting the exact cost , according to the demands of such sort of life as I had blundered into . 

<root> I 've seen the devil of violence , and the devil of greed , and the devil of hot desire ; but , by all the stars ! these were strong , lusty , red-eyed devils , that swayed and drove men â€“ men , I tell you . 

<root> But as I stood on this hillside , I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby , pretending , weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly . 

<root> How insidious he could be , too , I was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther . 

<root> For a moment I stood appalled , as though by a warning . 

<root> Finally I descended the hill , obliquely , towards the trees I had seen . 

<root> I avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope , the purpose of which I found it impossible to divine . 

<root> It was n't a quarry or a sandpit , anyhow . 

<root> It was just a hole . 

<root> It might have been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do . 

<root> I do n't know . 

<root> Then I nearly fell into a very narrow ravine , almost no more than a scar in the hillside . 

<root> I discovered that a lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in there . 

<root> There was n't one that was not broken . 

<root> It was a wanton smash-up . 

<root> at last I got under the trees . 

<root> My purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment ; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped into a gloomy circle of some Inferno . 

<root> The rapids were near , and an uninterrupted , uniform , headlong , rushing noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove , where not a breath stirred , not a leaf moved , with a mysterious sound â€“ as though the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible . 

<root> Black shapes crouched , lay , sat between the trees , leaning against the trunks , clinging to the earth , half coming out , half effaced within the dim light , in all the attitudes of pain , abandonment , and despair . 

<root> He is waiting ! ' 

<root> I did not see the real significance of that wreck at once . 

<root> I fancy I see it now , but I am not sure â€“ not at all . 

<root> Certainly the affair was too stupid â€“ when I think of it â€“ to be altogether natural . 

<root> Still ... But at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance . 

<root> The steamer was sunk . 

<root> They had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board , in charge of some volunteer skipper , and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones , and she sank near the south bank . 

<root> I asked myself what I was to do there , now my boat was lost . 

<root> As a matter of fact , I had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river . 

<root> I had to set about it the very next day . 

<root> That , and the repairs when I brought the pieces to the station , took some months . 

<root> My first interview with the manager was curious . 

<root> He did not ask me to sit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning . 

<root> He was commonplace in complexion , in features , in manners , and in voice . 

<root> He was of middle size and of ordinary build . 

<root> His eyes , of the usual blue , were perhaps remarkably cold , and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an axe . 

<root> But even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention . 

<root> Otherwise there was only an indefinable , faint expression of his lips , something stealthy â€“ a smile â€“ not a smile â€“ I remember it , but I ca n't explain . 

<root> It was unconscious , this smile was , though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant . 

<root> It came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable . 

<root> He was a common trader , from his youth up employed in these parts â€“ nothing more . 

<root> He was obeyed , yet he inspired neither love nor fear , nor even respect . 

<root> He inspired uneasiness . That was it ! Uneasiness . Not a definite mistrust â€“ just uneasiness â€“ nothing more . 

<root> You have no idea how effective such a ... a ... faculty can be . 

<root> He had no genius for organizing , for initiative , or for order even . 

<root> That was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station . 

<root> He had no learning , and no intelligence . 

<root> His position had come to him â€“ why ? Perhaps because he was never ill ... 

<root> He had served three terms of three years out there ... Because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself . 

<root> When he went home on leave he rioted on a large scale â€“ pompously . Jack ashore â€“ with a difference â€“ in externals only . 

<root> This one could gather from his casual talk . 

<root> He originated nothing , he could keep the routine going â€“ that 's all . But he was great . 

<root> He was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man . 

<root> He never gave that secret away . 

<root> Perhaps there was nothing within him . 

<root> Such a suspicion made one pause â€“ for out there there were no external checks . 

<root> Once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every agent in the station , he was heard to say , ' Men who come out here should have no entrails . 

<root> ' He sealed the utterance with that smile of his , as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping . 

<root> You fancied you had seen things â€“ but the seal was on . 

<root> When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence , he ordered an immense round table to be made , for which a special house had to be built . 

<root> This was the station 's mess-room . 

<root> Where he sat was the first place â€“ the rest were nowhere . 

<root> One felt this to be his unalterable conviction . 

<root> He was neither civil nor uncivil . 

<root> He was quiet . 

<root> He allowed his boy â€“ an overfed young negro from the coast â€“ to treat the white men , under his very eyes , with provoking insolence . 

<root> He began to speak as soon as he saw me . 

<root> I had been very long on the road . 

<root> He could not wait . Had to start without me . 

<root> The up-river stations had to be relieved . 

<root> There had been so many delays already that he did not know who was dead and who was alive , and how they got on â€“ and so on , and so on . 

<root> He paid no attention to my explanations , and , playing with a stick of sealing-wax , repeated several times that the situation was ' very grave , very grave . ' 

<root> There were rumors that a very important station was in jeopardy , and its chief , Mr. Kurtz , was ill . 

<root> Hoped it was not true . 

<root> Mr. Kurtz was ... 

<root> I felt weary and irritable . Hang Kurtz , I thought . 

<root> I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the coast . 

<root> ' Ah ! So they talk of him down there , he murmured to himself . 

<root> Then he began again , assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had , an exceptional man , of the greatest importance to the Company ; therefore I could understand his anxiety . 

<root> He was , he said , ' very , very uneasy . ' 

<root> Certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal , exclaimed , ' Ah , Mr. Kurtz ! ' broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumbfounded by the accident . 

<root> Next thing he wanted to know ' how long it would take to ' ... 

<root> I interrupted him again . 

<root> Being hungry , you know , and kept on my feet too , I was getting savage . 

<root> ' How could I tell , I said . ' 

<root> I had n't even seen the wreck yet â€“ some months , no doubt . 

<root> All this talk seemed to me so futile . 

<root> Some months , he said . 

<root> ' Well , let us say three months before we can make a start . 

<root> Yes . That ought to do the affair . 

<root> I flung out of his hut ( he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of veranda ) muttering to myself my opinion of him . 

<root> He was a chattering idiot . 

<root> Afterwards I took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the ' affair . ' 

<root> I went to work the next day , turning , so to speak , my back on that station . 

<root> In that way only it seemed to me I could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of life . 

<root> Still , one must look about sometimes ; and then I saw this station , these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard . 

<root> I asked myself sometimes what it all meant . 

<root> They wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands , like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence . 

<root> The word ' ivory ' rang in the air , was whispered , was sighed . 

<root> You would think they were praying to it . 

<root> A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all , like a whiff from some corpse . 

<root> By Jove ! I 've never seen anything so unreal in my life . 

<root> And outside , the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible , like evil or truth , waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion . 

<root> Oh , these months ! 

<root> Well , never mind . 

<root> Various things happened . 

<root> One evening a grass shed full of calico , cotton prints , beads , and I do n't know what else , burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash . 

<root> I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer , and saw them all cutting capers in the light , with their arms lifted high , when the stout man with mustaches came tearing down to the river , a tin pail in his hand , assured me that everybody was ' behaving splendidly , splendidly , ' dipped about a quart of water and tore back again . 

<root> I noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail . 

<root> I strolled up . 

<root> There was no hurry . 

<root> You see the thing had gone off like a box of matches . 

<root> It had been hopeless from the very first . The flame had leaped high , driven everybody back , lighted up everything â€“ and collapsed . 

<root> The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely . 

<root> A nigger was being beaten near by . 

<root> They said he had caused the fire in some way ; be that as it may , he was screeching most horribly . 

<root> I saw him , later on , for several days , sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself : 

<root> afterwards he arose and went out â€“ and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again . 

<root> As I approached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two men , talking . 

<root> I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced , then the words , ' take advantage of this unfortunate accident . ' 

<root> One of the men was the manager . 

<root> I wished him a good evening . 

<root> Did you ever see anything like it â€“ eh ? 

<root> it is incredible , he said , and walked off . 

<root> The other man remained . 

<root> He was a first-class agent , young , gentlemanly , a bit reserved , with a forked little beard and a hooked nose . 

<root> He was stand-offish with the other agents , and they on their side said he was the manager 's spy upon them . 

<root> As to me , I had hardly ever spoken to him before . 

<root> We got into talk , and by-and-by we strolled away from the hissing ruins . Then he asked me to his room , which was in the main building of the station . 

<root> He struck a match , and I perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself . 

<root> Just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles . 

<root> Native mats covered the clay walls ; a collection of spears , assegais , shields , knives was hung up in trophies . 

<root> The business intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks â€“ so I had been informed ; but there was n't a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station , and he had been there more than a year â€“ waiting . 

<root> It seems he could not make bricks without something , I do n't know what â€“ straw maybe . 

<root> Anyways , it could not be found there , and as it was not likely to be sent from Europe , it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for . 

<root> An act of special creation perhaps . 

<root> However , they were all waiting â€“ all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them â€“ for something ; and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation , from the way they took it , though the only thing that ever came to them was disease â€“ as far as I could see . 

<root> They beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way . 

<root> There was an air of plotting about that station , but nothing came of it , of course . 

<root> It was as unreal as everything else â€“ as the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern , as their talk , as their government , as their show of work . 

<root> The only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory was to be had , so that they could earn percentages . 

<root> They intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that account , â€“ but as to effectually lifting a little finger â€“ oh , no . By heavens ! 

<root> there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter . 

<root> Steal a horse straight out . Very well . He has done it . Perhaps he can ride . 

<root> But there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick . 

<root> From this standpoint , the evaluation of the implementation of the budget may take on a dimension that overrides matters of detail . 

<root> Errors of legality and regularity are increasing too . 

<root> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 

<root> The main importance of this agreement lies , I think , in its political nature . 

<root> The Council is extremely concerned at the latest developments in the Middle Eastern peace process . 

<root> Otherwise we will find ourselves forced to take more serious decisions as regards our trading relations with Israel . 

<root> Ojala recommendation for second reading ( A4-0072/97 ) 

<root> British Conservatives also believe that the Commission is wrong to bring forward this proposal in the name of the European Single Market . 

<root> Within the European Union , resale right exists in the legislation of eleven Member States , but it is only really applied in eight . 

<root> This report is no exception . 

<root> There are several reasons for this . 

<root> The European Commission maintains that everything depends on supply . 

<root> For the longer term , the preparatory mission recommended economic and financial aid to Albania . 

<root> Greece , Italy , France , Spain and Austria , have understood that something has to be done and now have a presence in Albania . 

<root> The European Union is not a military organization . 

<root> Many aspects of the transition have already been successfully debated and worked out , for example continuity in Kong 's civil service . 

<root> The European Union 's economic interests in Hong-Kong are both large in scale and deep-rooted . 

<root> I assure the House firmly that Hong-Kong will not slip from our sights in the Commission . 

<root> An unsuccessful transition will equally damage us all . 

<root> I also want to express my disagreement on the support given to the American law on Hong-Kong . 

<root> Let us say there has been an attempt to put technical make-up on the political face . 

<root> That is the line taken in the reports before you today . 

<root> We know that the refiners already have refineries producing clean diesel , but not for Europe . For the United States and Japan . 

<root> It is precisely when engines are claimed to be environment-friendly because they consume less fuel that we can not make any exceptions . 

<root> It needs greater definition on the issue of what is to be done at Community level in terms of employment policy . 

<root> Subject : The cost of enlargement 

<root> Everyone knows that it is politically impossible to turn to the Member States and ask for an increase in the Membership fee . 

<root> The sum of 12 million ECU has been made available for possible initiatives agreed with Cyprus for projects to promote confidence-building measures . 

<root> Naturally , the Turkish Cypriots will have a place in the representation of the lawful and internationally recognized government of Cyprus . 

<root> Question No-6 by Mr Pirker ( H-0218/97 ) 

<root> Subject : Europol 

<root> No major obstacles to ratification have been reported . 

<root> How long will the transitional period be following Polish accession in the case of the free movement of persons ? 

<root> This procedure guarantees that all countries applying for membership are treated equally . 

<root> I would remind you that the negotiations with Spain and Portugal lasted seven years . 

<root> This appears to be the case with the events which Mr Lomas reports in his question . 

<root> These statements are widely reported in the press . 

<root> Even civil servants at national and local government level in Britain are not allowed to get involved in electioneering as the Commissioners are doing . 

<root> Do you not think some of them , not all , are getting too big for their boots . 

<root> Also adopted was Directive 96/23 on supervisory measures for implementing this tougher policy . 

<root> Subject : The EU as an association of free and independent States 

<root> If I understand the interpreting correctly it seems that Mr SjÃ¶stedt himself believes that national constitutions are more important than Community law . 

<root> Question No-15 by Mr Medina Ortega ( H-0237/97 ) 

<root> It will also give us a future in the two very important industries that we can not ignore and ensure Europe 's future prosperity . 

<root> Also , some serious targets must now finally be set for the car industry . 

<root> We have done considerable research before coming to the conclusions before us tonight . 

<root> STOA , to produce for us a paper which indicated low sulphur fuels are essential . 

<root> Secondly , in any case , they have to refurbish and invest in their refineries continuously . 

<root> The rapporteur is asking for a threshold of 50 to 30 ppm , which would also involve excessive cost without appreciable benefit . 

<root> The fiscal advantages for clean vehicles could then be introduced some two years before the new standards take effect . 

<root> It emerged from the hearing that the sulphur content , in particular , of both petrol and diesel could be much lower . 

<root> A further nine percent can be eliminated over the next eight years , at a reasonable cost . 

<root> Madam President , there are only two ways to improve air quality . 

<root> But two groups are in confrontation . 

<root> We look forward to what the Commission has to say but I would sound a note of warning . 

<root> The car concept has got off to a good start . 

<root> What was the actual driving force behind this programme ? 

<root> We will change this programme so that the driving force behind it is the future and innovation . 

<root> In the proposal for a directive , summer begins on 1 April and ends on 30 September . 

<root> The report contains a number of proposals for tax concessions which many other speakers have mentioned in this evening 's debate . 

<root> For that reason the Commission believes that it is still too early to fix limit values for fuel quality for the year 2005 . 

<root> These are Amendments Nos 22 , 23 , 37 and 38 . 

<root> The Commission has proposed fuel specifications for the year 2000 . 

<root> Madam President , there has clearly been a misunderstanding . 

<root> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 

<root> And the national judges frequently have difficulty in understanding and applying the concept of indirect discrimination . 

<root> The directive codifies the case law of the Court of Justice and ensures that it will be consistently applied . 

<root> British women too are entitled to the same treatment as all the other citizens of Europe . 

<root> She has already spoken on the subject , and other colleagues will be doing so as well . 

<root> What is being asked of small employers here is very difficult . 

<root> All of us as MEPs are small employers too . 

<root> in order to bring immediate results it will also be necessary to have constant monitoring of the implementation of the directive . 

<root> The problems caused by the absence of transparency are particularly severe . 

<root> As a final point I emphasize that the existing positive actions must be kept in place . 

<root> Shared responsibilities , both at work and in the family mean a better quality of life for both men and women . 

<root> That was also mentioned by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Glase . 

<root> The Minutes of the part-session of Thursday 29 May 1997 have been distributed . 

<root> Why do I raise the matter ? 

<root> I give the floor to Mrs Green . 

<root> Thursday does not seem like a good idea . 

<root> Mr President , my report also concerns agriculture , bee-keeping to be precise . 

<root> In other words , not your report . 

<root> Petitions 1996-1997 

<root> Citizens take their right to petition seriously . 

<root> Sadly my report is not all plaudits . 

<root> I wonder whether they are in the debate this evening . 

<root> In that case , the matter turns out to be a national problem after all . 

<root> It is possible when the matter is raised with the Committee on Petitions . 

<root> So it is essential that we activate this right fully . 

<root> He won a case against the Greek railways several years ago and he is owed several thousand pounds by them . 

<root> Thank you very much , Commissioner . 

<root> We have shown that the future of the audio-visual industry is a debate which crosses all political and national boundaries . 

<root> We must be able to create and see our own stories , be it Inspector Morse or Derrick . 

<root> We can not accept that situation . The first reading provided a remedy . 

<root> As far as I know , Madam President , lies are not accepted in any parliament . 

<root> Copyright and the EU 's principle of free competition should be taken into account in the televising of sports as of other events . 

<root> Which will be seen and which not ? 

<root> Thanks to all this it will now be more difficult for public and private broadcasters to ignore the rules contained in the directive . 

<root> For European citizens , it ensures that the public interest is taken into consideration , which is so important to their daily lives . 

<root> Thank you very much , Commissioner . 

<root> Our fellow citizens ' days and nights are becoming increasingly noisy . 

<root> Two months ago I had to have an operation for a serious complaint . 

<root> No doubt much of what our citizens experience as noise does not fall within the competence of the Union . 

<root> And this is one of the oldest pieces of environmental legislation that we have in Europe . 

<root> I am thinking here of airport zones , high-speed trains and major motorways . 

<root> This refusal can be interpreted as indirect encouragement of the impunity and immunity of the terrorists of yesterday , today and tomorrow . 

<root> Resignation of a Vice-President 

<root> The next item is the order of business . 

<root> I would remind you that Mr Cornelissen 's report has been added to the agenda for Tuesday . 

<root> I hope she will take note of this , because it is an important point . 

<root> ( The President cut off the speaker ) 

<root> The next item is the joint debate on the following statement and oral question : 

<root> For this reason , the initiative of the Commission is worthy of our congratulations . 

<root> My group , the Liberal group , is presently focusing its attention on non-European Union nationals . 

<root> They are no longer allowed to practise their previous activities as doctors , teachers , members of parliament . 

<root> Madam President , I would also like to thank Mrs Bonino wholeheartedly for her work on behalf of the women in Kabul . 

<root> Barbaric violence can only be fought when democracy is supported . 

<root> The debate is closed . 

<root> There have only been a few isolated amendments opposed to this approach and these were subsequently rejected . 

<root> Madam President , my group supports the rapporteur 's position . 

<root> I fully support the need for contacts with third countries . 

<root> Secondly , we should not allow this to be postponed indefinitely , and we should not introduce provisions restricted to physical persons . 

<root> But that is not the language used in everyday encounters with the bemused populations of the EU countries . 

<root> Two approaches are becoming clear , one of which is a pragmatic approach . 

<root> Have negotiations really begun ? 

<root> Today we have two directives before us , including this one on capital income . 

<root> Finally , it is my belief that it is not for us to deal with rate levels . 

<root> I believe this is a job for the final compromise round of Europe 's finance ministers . 

<root> Where coordinating tax policy is concerned , the main objective is to limit manoeuvring and distortions on the capital markets . 

<root> My country is one of them . 

<root> Yet another amendment is aimed at simplification , taking references to the tank to include its accessories as a matter of course . 

<root> The sitting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. until voting time at 11.30 a.m. . 

<root> Your predecessor said earlier â€“ we only finished the debate barely twenty minutes ago â€“ that this report would be voted on tomorrow . 

<root> Now we come to the references to Macao . 

<root> In the motion for a resolution , we have : 

<root> The way China develops is vital for the way our own societies develop . 

<root> It will influence not only our economies but also , and above all , prospects for democracy world-wide . 

<root> Directive 96/96/EC established the principle that commercial road vehicles must undergo an annual roadworthiness test at an approved testing centre . 

<root> However , I seriously doubt that the introduction of free market principles , which the report so enthusiastically recommends , is the right solution . 

<root> It would not be a good thing to blindly apply competition rules and risk endangering the efficiency of Community and national interventions . 

<root> In addition , the Commission has exclusive competence in matters of state aid . 

<root> In its communication , the Commission has presented some proposals for greater consistency between regional policy and competition policy in the EU . 

<root> This solution must not become entrenched in a national-level mentality . 

<root> The Commission has already established a number of actions to help them . 

<root> It concentrates on combating unemployment and ensuring that everyone has a job . 

<root> No one is left out ; there are clear references to women , for example . 

<root> It is heartening that the European Union recognises the problems and is willing to focus on them . 

<root> Let us make it clear that the collection of clothing for people in third countries who need it can continue . 

<root> We must accept that . 

<root> The problem is that in many EU Member States it has become the easy option with dire consequences for the environment . 

<root> I reserve my right to come back on this when it goes back to committee . 

<root> On the question of whether to exempt energy-intensive industries , in our view the Commission 's proposal has advantages and disadvantages . 

<root> The international exemption for aircraft kerosene must be abolished as quickly as possible . 

<root> The indexing of minimum rates introduced by Mr Cox is a good way of making the regulation simple and reliable . 

<root> As a result , the legislation is complex , hard to understand and difficult to apply . 

<root> Standards have been raised , and the question of the radio ham has also been given attention . 

<root> If I have a criticism of the Legal Affairs Committee 's opinion , it is that it is too one-sided . 

<root> I salute him for all he has done in this area . 

<root> A further point was how private copying should be regulated in the digital environment . 

<root> Broad sections of the population having access to these new forms of knowledge and learning is something we should very much welcome . 

<root> It is a directive which safeguards the interests of rightholders and protects intellectual property . 

<root> That is why the Socialist Group will be supporting this position . 

<root> The first concerns the limitations on copyright , in which context we have logically proposed providing compensation . 

<root> In the first place , there are the creators . 

<root> There are no clearly defined rules governing the sharing of responsibility . 

<root> Cultural differences do exist , and so I do not understand why there should not be mandatory provision for exemptions . 

<root> Some time ago we debated about giving the rights to artists who sell their artwork . 

<root> Since that legislation came into being , there has been no noticeable difference . 

<root> There is a proper balanced way to achieve the rights that everybody here wants to see . 

<root> What is most needed in this , as well as in other areas , is a serious in depth analysis of the problems . 

<root> This is a right which does not incur financial consequences . 

<root> Mr President , many thanks to Mr Barzanti . 

<root> We are told we must balance interests but , quite frankly , all interests are not equal . 

<root> Blank screens will not enrich our society . 

<root> Too many continue to scrape together a living in a kind of La BohÃ©me garret . 

<root> Some would argue that there should be fair use without fair compensation . 

<root> Allow the creators and others in the United Kingdom to have a fair debate about whether we should have a blank tape levy . 

<root> Copyright holders are given an absolute right to protection , with the banning of copying for private use for example . 

<root> Let us be honest . 

<root> It may seem that the common agricultural policy or the trans-European transport network are higher priorities , but they are not . 

<root> If these products are in short supply or of inferior quality , that will sound the death-knell for Europe . 

<root> There are some very clear examples of this in the recitals . 

<root> The ball is now in the Commission 's court . 

<root> At one time , almost all Europe 's major hits came into being with the help of a producer who believed in them . 

<root> We feel that the Internet provides an effective way of avoiding that stranglehold . 

<root> The information society is in fact evolving in a global context . 

<root> I am well aware that this was also the aim of Parliament 's work . 

<root> We can not , however , accept the concept of ' economic significance ' for the rightholder . 

<root> Your amendments uphold two important principles : the right of rightholders to fair remuneration and the fine distinction concerning private digital copies . 

<root> The first principle protects a need for equity ; it is a measured step forwards in the quest for legal certainty in this sector . 

<root> That is a formula which allows broader harmonisation and respects the traditions and practices of the Member States . 

<root> The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon . 

<root> C4-0497/98-98/0126 ( CNS ) . 

<root> The very structure of the text of the COM in wine shows us that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product . 

<root> Mr President , I should like to start by offering my sincere thanks to Mr Martin . 

<root> The proposal , Commissioner Fischler , was also not nearly as good as this one . 

<root> Circumstances have changed in some respects , while in others they have remained the same . 

<root> That is why we support the Agriculture Committee 's call for a framework regulation . 

<root> Each area has its own way of making wine . 

<root> We will only counter overproduction by introducing comprehensive new quality criteria . 

<root> We support Mr Martin 's report and we say one thing : quality not quantity ! 

<root> Contrary to the Commission proposals , we must preserve the current procedure known as the Article 43 procedure . 

<root> That is the information I have on this type of activity . 

<root> You have the floor , Mr Van Miert . 

<root> Mr President , there has been considerable progress made with regard to the internal market for medicinal products . 

<root> It will be borne by the consumers and will constitute an additional element of the price of electricity used . 

<root> I should just like to confirm that the Commissioner and the French Minister for Europe are both agreed on that point . 

<root> I was obviously anxious to hear the speech in full , 

<root> In any case , I congratulate Mrs Thors on her French ; I certainly can not speak in Swedish or Finnish . 

<root> Once again , it is a question of habit . 

<root> This also applies to charges on cross-border transfers . 

<root> We have done so : on 5 February we published an extremely detailed press release dealing with the questions you have raised . 

<root> I will bear in mind however , as these debates are of especial interest to me , that Spain has been particularly affected . 

<root> Question No-46 by Christine Oddy ( H-0002/99 ) 

<root> I am pleased to confirm that the Commission has received the report to which the honourable Member refers . 

<root> Mr Hatzidakis now has the floor for one minute , and his will be the last question to Mr van den Broek today . 

<root> As regards the negotiations , you know the Commission 's position . 

<root> Question No-59 by Alex Smith ( H-0045/99 ) 

<root> I must confess I am totally surprised that the Commission was not aware of this report , given its sensitivity at this particular time . 

<root> So I do not have a supplementary question , I just want to register my protest . 

<root> My question is related to Mr Smith 's question . 

<root> It has always failed to deal with the real issue , namely the closing-down of Sellafield . 

<root> I have sat here patiently and I find it quite extraordinary that you are not calling me . 

<root> Instead of that , you called Mr Fitzsimons as a supplementary to Mr Smith . 

<root> I have the impression that the honourable Member believes the public invitation to tender in connection with the tunnel has already started . 

<root> The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m and resumed at 9 p.m . 

<root> Common organisation of the market in wine ( continuation ) 

<root> I also think that the Commission 's proposals are better able to provide this guarantee of dynamic equilibrium . 

<root> This also means that in several areas the report does not follow the liberal proposals made by the Commission . 

<root> Everyone can see that the draft CAP reforms tend to become embedded in the rut defined by the Commission 's too liberal tendencies . 

<root> The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is very attentive to the demands of the experts and of society . 

<root> This is why we will be approving the report which has been presented to us . 

<root> I hope that the debate on wine-growing will benefit the wine producer , the product and the consumer alike . 

<root> More must be done to promote the product on the international markets . 

<root> We are always talking about quality ; well , I believe that quality also means giving priority to products wholly derived from the vine . 

<root> Unfortunately , with respect , it shows an enormous ignorance of what actually happens to wine in those countries that it is shipped to . 

<root> Ladies and gentlemen from both North and South , we must vote in favour of this report . 

<root> Commissioner Brittan should know this . 

<root> The appropriate forum for the settlement of this dispute is the World Trade Organisation . 

<root> I therefore urge the German presidency to take whatever initiative is necessary in the Bonn EU/US summit in June . 

<root> It is as if someone were to steal my wallet and I were then expected to sit down and negotiate with him . 

<root> So , let us take the gloves off . 

<root> We shall not only condemn them . 

<root> It affects people and it reaches them at different times and on different issues . 

<root> I can now give the floor to one speaker in favour and one against . 

<root> A pirate electronic version is available but not in French . 

<root> In addition to the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy , the financing of the Community needs to undergo radical reform . 

<root> President Santer rightly pointed out that financial reform is one of the main pillars of Agenda 2000 . 

<root> You can see that just by looking at the current discussions in the Council . 

<root> Work that one out if you can ! 

<root> At the same time that one truly European own resource is waning rapidly in its importance . 

<root> Yet , the good old traditional own resources are the cause of major headaches for control and concern about fraud . 

<root> We have a system of own resources that is extremely complex and lacking in transparency . 

<root> It makes life very difficult for Members , Commissioners and the press . 

<root> At any rate , there is still quite a lot of circumvention and evasion in this area by the Member States . 

<root> Mr President , I should also like to compliment Mrs Haug on her report . 

<root> These are very fundamental points for the future . 

<root> It is a question of appropriateness and of review . 

<root> What policies and at what level ? 

<root> Only one thing can protect us from this unfortunate fate and that is the rule of unanimity . 

<root> I should like to welcome Mrs Cresson and ask her to reply to Mr Valverde 's question . 

<root> Thank you very much . 

<root> The premises you visited do not belong to the European Commission and the staff you met are not employed by the European Commission . 

<root> I am unaware of the reasons behind this situation you describe though I can make an educated guess at them . 

<root> Could you please explain it more clearly ? 

<root> What I have been hearing about the representative in Nicaragua is indicative that the project had not been properly closed down . 

<root> I would like to make that crystal-clear . 

<root> I am referring to the Rio Coco project . 

<root> Mr Martin , please reply without engaging in a dialogue , as the Rules do not provide for one . 

<root> Originally , a proposal was promised for the beginning of last year . 

<root> I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question . 

<root> I just hope that I will be invited to the opening ceremony because we worked damned hard to get it . 

<root> Thank you , Mr Kinnock . 

<root> Question No-44 by Bernie Malone ( H-0209/99 ) 

<root> European exports rose during that period but the situation has now been rectified . 

<root> The only product of any significance is canned tomatoes , but even they account for no more than 7 -% of the market . 

<root> For my part , I feel that the negotiations were balanced and that they open the way for achieving a sustainable market . 

<root> You know yourself that the agreement with South Africa was held up because of the fisheries question , too . 

<root> You have to take more into account the whole question of , not just giving aid , but fair trade . 

<root> The overall amount was 6500 tonnes of canned tomatoes . 

<root> We shall be discussing the new trends in consumption and trafficking and the prospects for the future . 

<root> Many lives are wasted every year because of the depredations of the people-smugglers . 

<root> We know for certain that those who try to reach the coast of Europe by sea from Morocco often meet a grim fate . 

<root> In 1996 , the EDU 's mandate was extended to include the smuggling of human beings . 

<root> We know that there are boats plying between Morocco and Spain and Gibraltar , and that the different authorities concerned are cooperating fully . 

<root> What do you think are the target routes here ? 

<root> Question No-49 will therefore receive a written answer . 

<root> We are closely monitoring the matter and should know whether the regime has been modified within the next few weeks . 

<root> Secondly , the origin rules applicable to imports to third countries from the Community are still based on individual Member States . 

<root> Detailed statistics on EU trade with Cuba are not available . 

<root> I understand from sources in the Scottish industry that there is a major company involved in Norway at the moment . 

<root> As I have said , 84 exporters have had the undertakings replaced by duties instead . 

<root> This has led to the adoption of a common position on Burma and the withdrawal of GSP benefits . 

<root> In this case we are talking about the market for processed meat products . 

<root> I had therefore been hoping for a common sense reply , Commissioner , not a technical one . 

<root> The directive is more modest . 

<root> How could millions of customers be reimbursed if the charge had already been included in their electricity bills ? 

<root> Questions Nos 60 to 111 will therefore receive written answers . 

<root> That concludes Question Time . 

<root> For electoral reasons and in order to appeal to the masses , the subject has been brought up again . 

<root> It aims at the heart of the matter , as Agenda 2000 negotiations have reached a critical stage . 

<root> The issue is the financing of EU enlargement . 

<root> We are now fighting over who is going to pay for it . 

<root> I speak on behalf of the British Labour Members on that major area of dissent . 

<root> At the moment , Germany has a massive surplus in its balance of trade with the rest of the Union , something like 25 billion . 

<root> Firstly , does the total amount of Community budget receipts cover the current requirement of the European Union ? 

<root> How much further do you want it to fall ? 

<root> Let us just reflect on the fact that , without a common agricultural policy , there would be no European Union today . 

<root> We therefore had to meet these two fundamental objectives and I sincerely believe that we are close to achieving this . 

<root> Some merely refer to purely linguistic and formal aspects . 

<root> We transport politicians always try to be precise , without letting things get out of hand . 

<root> During the conciliation procedure the Commission , indeed you , Commissioner , declared that a proposal on seaports would be on the table immediately . 

<root> There are two other points I would like to address . 

<root> Then there is the famous project No-8 of the 14 very important projects endorsed by the Essen summit . 

<root> We have worked on the networks too long for this to happen . 

<root> That is what I want to talk about today . 

<root> I admit that , Commissioner , and also thank the Commission for improving its proposal compared to the original text . 

<root> We need a brief report summarising the experience gained and a clear review . 

<root> A very clear and accurate analysis of both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean ports is required . 

<root> That makes sense because the viability of infrastructure investments obviously depends on competitive revenue-raising services and competitive services clearly need quality infrastructure . 

<root> Amendment No-6 makes more radical changes to the guideline maps , adding new links and creating new categories of ports . 

<root> All I would regret was his prolonged absence from this House . 

<root> This , however , is not the proposal before the House . 

<root> That he always gets , whether he likes it or not . 

<root> Thank you , Mr Kinnock . 

<root> There is much talk of privatisation and liberalisation . 

<root> But privatisation does not even come into question in this context , it is not being proposed . 

<root> It is up to the railway undertakings to decide whether to do so more in the form of cooperation or of competition . 

<root> I believe the Commission has done a very good job in many cases . 

<root> Each country should continue to be able to regulate this as it wishes in its area of jurisdiction . 

<root> Personally , I should like to see a number of other requirements deleted . 

<root> Consequently , the proposals could , in practice , produce the opposite effect to that intended and become an obstacle to increased competition . 

<root> Many countries and regions are worried , and perhaps with reason . 

<root> But the opportunity for the renaissance of the railways is at hand , and that is what we should strive for . 

<root> Compared with my own objectives , I do not think the demands made by either of them are tough enough . 

<root> Mr President , here too I must congratulate the two rapporteurs . 

<root> But there are a few facts that we must face . 

<root> I do not agree with him at all . 

<root> How can we license individual operators if we do not make that separation ? 

<root> Why do we say that ? 

<root> Firstly , the amendment of the concept of authorised applicants which allows any natural or legal person to request infrastructure capacity . 

<root> We all know that the market share of the railways has declined in recent years . 

<root> My group welcomes that opportunity and supports the Commission and our rapporteurs in their efforts to secure a future for Europe 's railways . 

<root> Both the reports before us today represent further necessary steps along the same road . 

<root> If rail is to have real vitality , then rail is going to have to change . 

<root> It results in a less clear definition and is , in our view , an unnecessary change . 

<root> I have great sympathy with the view that Community legislation should not be over-prescriptive . 

<root> There are a number of key points that I would like to address before concluding . 

<root> It will encourage them to place greater reliance on this mode of transport . 

<root> They have to make a stronger commitment to rail . 

<root> I conclude by thanking both rapporteurs , 

<root> I hope that the whole House will endorse their constructive approach . 

<root> So there is no question of closing down , there is a question of the practical discretion of the committee . 

<root> We will meet that commitment . 

<root> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 

<root> Perhaps it is especially important , however , to define in precise terms the responsibility that city will have to assume . 

<root> A bird cried out on the roof , and he woke up . 

<root> It was the middle of the afternoon , in the heat , in Africa ; 

<root> he knew at once where he was . 

<root> The road to the village would be blocked , the dog ran over the soft fields breathing like a dragon ... 

<root> the kernel of the house was warm with oil-fired heating and the light from red shades , 

<root> the silky colours of Olivia 's things ... the rugs , cherry- and satin-wood pieces ... and the red earth pots , bits of beadwork , the two fine carvings they once found in the Congo . 

<root> A few days ago he was in that house , packing to leave in the flat progression of practical matters by which decision is broken up into reality . 

<root> If you have any trouble with the boiler , for heaven 's sake let Mackie look at it before you send to town . 

<root> What a pity you gave away your shorts . 

<root> There 's no knowing if I 'll be anywhere where I could dare appear in shorts , any more . 

<root> But your waist measurement has n't changed by so much as half an inch ... 

<root> I know by your pyjama trousers , I use exactly the same measurement for new elastic as I always did . 

<root> Three months before , Adamson Mweta stood outside a steak house in Kensington and said to him , 

<root> Of course you 'll come back to us now ! 

<root> He had driven home , slowing down on the empty road that led through the fullness of a deserted summer twilight , at last , to the house . 

<root> Housing estates overrun villages all over England , but here the process had been reversed ; the house had once been a manor ( Olivia thought that , even earlier , it had been a priory ) but in the nineteenth century the village was depopulated by the drift to industrialized towns , lost its autonomy , and died ; the shop-cum-post-office had closed , the cottages had fallen down ; 

<root> As Olivia said , it ought to have been a sad-feeling place but it was n't ; there was instead a renewal : the country had come back , bringing the reassurance of stubborn peace and fecundity , a beginning again . 

<root> And they were only two-hours-and-a-bit from London , their daughters and their friends . 

<root> He had kept up , since he finally left Africa ten years ago , a close contact with Adamson Mweta and the other leaders of the African independence movement . 

<root> He spent a great deal of time going back and forth to London to advise them when they conferred with the Colonial Office , and to do what he could to smooth the way for various delegations that came to petition against the old constitution and to negotiate independence for their country . 

<root> It was there , in this Central African territory , that he had been a colonial servant until the settlers succeeded in having him recalled and deported for his support of the People 's Independence Party . 

<root> He said to his wife , Mweta 's invited me to come back as their guest . 

<root> Well , you ought to be at the Independence celebrations , if anyone is . 

<root> That 's marvellous . 

<root> She used to make packages of sandwiches for Mweta to take with him when he cycled for miles about Gala province at weekends , speaking at meetings . 

<root> He said to Adamson Mweta before they parted the next day , Olivia wo n't be able to come out to Independence , unfortunately ... our elder daughter 's expecting a child just round about that time . 

<root> Mweta said , with his slow shy smile that always seemed to grow like a light becoming more powerful , as his eyes held you , You mean little Venetia ? 

<root> She going to be a mother ? 

<root> I 'm afraid so , he mumbled in his Englishman 's way . 

<root> Well , that 's good , that 's good . 

<root> Never mind , Mrs. Bray will join you later . 

<root> I imagine by the time she 's prepared to trust the baby to Venetia the celebrations 'll be over . 

<root> That 's what I mean â€“ 

<root> you 'll be more or less settled by the time she arrives . 

<root> They were standing at the door of Mweta 's taxi ; there was a sudden uprush of feeling between the two men ; the Englishman stood there , the small , quick black man took him by the biceps , hard , through his dark suit , as in his own country he would have linked fingers with a brother . 

<root> Under the release of physical contact , he said to Mweta , I do n't know what we 're talking about , and Mweta said , You ... I told you we expect you back , now . 

<root> But what would I do ? 

<root> What use should I be to you ? 

<root> He was so accustomed to effacing himself in the hours of discussion of constitutional law and political tactics ( a white man , an outsider offering impersonal service for whatever it was worth ) ... 

<root> a strong consciousness of his own being flooded him as if a stimulant had been injected into his veins . 

<root> Whatever you like ! 

<root> It 's all ours ! 

<root> We need you ; whatever you like ! 

<root> Mweta broke away and jumped into the taxi . 

<root> The pale stone faÃ§ade with its stone lintels and sills worn smooth as a piece of used soap was directly on the empty road but the real face of the house was the other side . 

<root> Sheltered by the building the garden was a grassy look-out over fuzzy colours of flowers , bees , and early moths to the long valley . 

<root> He and Olivia gardened on summer evenings , not seriously , as she did during the day , but desultorily pulling out a tall rank weed here or there , for the pleasure of feeling its roots yield from the humus and bring up , in the crumbs clinging to that beard grown underground , a smell of earth rich as fruit-cake . 

<root> They had laid flag-stones under the walnut trees for the white wooden chairs and table , so that it would n't be too damp . 

<root> They drank whisky there , or even the coffee after dinner . 

<root> Sometimes before the dusk wavered the wood away into the distance , he went out into the sunlight that collected like golden water in the dip of the meadows and shot a partridge . 

<root> There was no one to bother about shooting rights . 

<root> Afterwards as the evening faded he cleaned the gun almost by feel and the clean , practical smell of gun-oil conveyed the simple satisfaction of the task . 

<root> Olivia played records with the living-room windows wide open so that the music came out to them . 

<root> This summer it was Stravinsky and Poulenc ; 

<root> she was of the generation and class that paid other women to knit and now that she herself was about to be a grandmother she made funny stuffed toys for nieces and nephews . 

<root> She had a cigar box full of odd buttons , as a supply of eyes , but she put it away from her because one of the things she had hated when she was young was the show of dissembling older women made when confronted with something vital to them . 

<root> I suppose we said many times we 'd come back when they got their independence . 

<root> She gave a small , self-questioning shrug , admitting the glibness of another kind of daily talk in another time . 

<root> It 's not because of what one said . 

<root> But both knew that , in those days , the important thing was to give Adamson Mweta faith in himself by positing a future that was real because you , a white person with nothing personal to gain by it , showed you believed it would come about . 

<root> Gazing out across the valley and then calmly at him , she had her look of wanting to find out exactly what they were talking about . 

<root> He said , Certainly I thought of going back , then . Before we left . 

<root> Just as I knew we should have to leave . 

<root> Poor Adamson , it looked pretty hopeless at times . 

<root> And yet it 's come so quickly . 

<root> Ten years . 

<root> Ten years since they had been deported from the territory , ten years since she was a youngish woman of forty , and the girls were still schoolgirls . 

<root> Historically , yes , it would happen but not to Adamson , and not to us ? 

<root> The house they had bought , filled with possessions that had been stored all the years they were in Africa , the garden they had made , spoke for them . 

<root> It was not a house to be quitted . 

<root> They expect you back , she said with pride . 

<root> Adamson was in the flush of victory , all right . 

<root> I think he 'd have embraced Henry Davis . 

<root> Davis was the settler M.P. who had been responsible , at one stage , for getting Mweta banished to the far Western Province . 

<root> He naturally assumes you 'll come out of exile . 

<root> They laughed . 

<root> But they were talking of Mweta ; 

<root> the strange shyness of twenty-two years of marriage made it impossible for her to say : Do you want to go ? 

<root> The passionate beginning , the long openness and understanding between them should have meant that she would know what he wanted . 

<root> And in a way she did know : because it was for them a code so deeply accepted that it had never been discussed ... 

<root> one was available wherever one was of use . 

<root> What else was there to live by ? 

<root> And so the question of what they were talking about really amounted to her hidden , pressed-down , banked-over desire to know whether this house , this life in Wiltshire , this life â€“ at last â€“ seemed to him the definitive one , in the end . 

<root> Because she was suddenly realizing that it had been so for her . 

<root> She was , after all ( in the true sense of after all that had gone before ) an Englishwoman . 

<root> She had taken out of storage the furniture and family possessions that had been nothing but a nuisance to her when they left England together twenty years ago , and , putting them in place , inevitably had accepted the life the arrangement of such objects provided for , and her comfortable private income made possible . 

<root> In the room they had decided upon for his study , the desk from her great-grandfather that had naturally become his â€“ a quiet field of black-red morocco scratched with almost erased gold â€“ was a place to write the properly documented history of the territory ( Mweta 's country ) that had never been done before ; not the boxwood Colonial Office desk at which one dealt with government forms and made the empirical scribbles of administration or politics . 

<root> In the scented , mothy evening she felt the presence of the house like someone standing behind her . 

<root> She did not know whether he felt it too ; and she could not try to find out because if it turned out that he did n't â€“ she had a premonition , sometimes , that in middle age you could find you had lost everything in a moment : husband â€“ lover , friend , children , it was as if they had never happened , or you had wandered off from them without knowing , and now stood stock-still with the discovery . 

<root> They watched the moths in the tobacco flowers . 

<root> She said in her sensible , inquiring , Englishwoman 's voice behind which generations of her kind had sheltered , Did Mweta say how long ? 

<root> It was very much a gesture ! 

<root> No , but he 'd already mentioned it yesterday , is n't that so ? 

<root> You misunderstood him yesterday . 

<root> A year ? Six months ? ... What ? 

<root> White people given appointments in African countries after independence were usually employed on contract . 

<root> Good Lord , I 've no idea , I 'm sure he has n't either . 

<root> It 's all in the air . 

<root> Olivia went in to change the record and because it was , unexpectedly , Mozart â€“ the harp and Mute concerto â€“ he lit a cigar to smoke while he enjoyed it . 

<root> She wandered down to the herb garden and brought back a branch of dill ; 

<root> There he is , she said . 

<root> It was their owl , a youngster who had hatched out down in the field and was heard every night . 

<root> She remarked that tomorrow she must pick the dill for drying . 

<root> Everything was just as it was . 

<root> But everything was changed . 

<root> All had turned over in the barrel of the world and steadied itself again . 

<root> She knew , if he did n't , that he was going . 

<root> It was night in Europe all the way . 

<root> Dark rain in the afternoon in London when the plane took off , at Rome the airport a vast , bleary shopwindow shining blurred colours through rain . 

<root> He hauled down his coat again to get out at Athens . 

<root> The metal rail of the steps wheeled against the plane was icy-wet to his palm and in the streaming rain he did not smell the Aegean or thyme , as he had remembered from other journeys to Africa . 

<root> Inside the airport under the yellow light the passengers sat down again on exhausted-looking chairs , bundled deep in their heavy clothing . 

<root> An old woman with crinkly grey hair woke up at her post outside the lavatory and opened the door , smiling and grasping a filthy cleaning rag . 

<root> He walked around to ease the cramp in his knees but there was a small circumference and within a few strides one found oneself back again at the shop , before which women and child passengers were drawn to gaze at embroidered aprons and evzone dolls . 

<root> A girl of ten or eleven with the badges of the cantons of Switzerland sewn to the sleeve of her coat had exactly the look of Venetia at that age . 

<root> He bought a postcard of brilliant blue sea and dazzling white ruins and tried to write , in what he could remember of Greek : 

<root> Winter and darkness here but in Cambridge , perhaps , there 's already spring yelling its head off ? 

<root> My love to you , James . 

<root> Venetia had had a first in Greek , herself , only a year ago , and could laugh over the mistakes . 

<root> But that was the end of Europe . 

<root> At Kano a huge moon shone and in a light brighter than a European winter afternoon the passengers made their way across the tarmac at three in the morning against the resistance of a heat of the day persisting all through the night as the sun persists in a stone it has warmed . 

<root> There was a smell of woodsmoke ; 

<root> the men moving about beneath the belly of the plane had bare black feet . 

<root> When the passengers climbed aboard again , their clothes felt hairy and the plane was airless . 

<root> He put the coat away on the rack , apologizing , trying not to hamper other people in the general move to rearrange gear ; the anticipation of arrival , still some hours off , aroused in them not so much common purpose as a spread of instinct as in the lifted heads of a herd become aware of the promise of water . 

<root> When the sun rose some slumped off into sleep , but women began to examine the plastic bags in which they kept their hats , and , as the hard beams of the sun struck into the cabin on hairnets , pale lips , and stubble , queues formed for the lavatories . 

<root> While he was writing on the customs and immigration form , BRAY , Evelyn James , and the number of his passport , someone was reading his name over his shoulder ; he flexed it awkwardly , not because he minded , but in mild embarrassment . 

<root> The queue for the lavatory moved along a notch , he glanced up and the man , carrying a flowered sponge-bag , caught his eye with a tired vacant stare that changed to an expression of greeting . 

<root> The woman who had dozed beside him all night communicating the intimate rhythm of her breathing but never exchanging a word , suddenly began to talk like a bird who has the cover taken off its cage . 

<root> He wedged himself between the seats to recover the shoe she had lost somewhere over a distant desert ; 

<root> she laughed , protested apologetically , and shook cologne down into her freckled bosom . 

<root> Dragging back the little curtain from the oval window , she looked into the dazzling glare of space and said , Glorious morning up here ! and they discussed with animation the cold and sudden winter that was left behind . 

<root> As he did not have a window seat he did not see the bush and the earth red as brick-dust and the furze of growth along the river-beds : 

<root> not until the plane had come to a stop on the runway , and they were waiting for the health inspector to come aboard . 

<root> He unhooked his safety belt and leaned over to look at an angle through the bleary lens on the far side of the aisle ; and there it was , tiny and distorted and real , bush , earth , exactly as it remained in his mind always , without his thinking about it . 

<root> It was underfoot . 

<root> It was around . 

<root> A black man in khaki shorts ( used to be a white man in white stockings ) sprayed a cloyingly perfumed insecticide over the passengers ' heads as a precaution against the plane harbouring mosquitoes and tsetse flies . 

<root> The doors opened ; voices from without came in on currents of air ; he emerged among the others into heady recognition taken in at all the senses , walking steadily across the tarmac through the raw-potato whiff of the undergrowth , the fresh , early warmth on hands , the cool metallic taste of last night 's storm at the back of the throat , 

<root> The disembarking passengers were all strangers again , connected not with each other but to the mouthing , smiling faces and waving hands on the airport balcony . 

<root> He knew no one but the walk was processional , a reception to him , and by the time he entered the building over the steps where , as always , dead insects fallen from the light during the night had not been swept away , it was all as suddenly familiar and ordinary as the faces other people were greeting were , to them . 

<root> Waiting to be summoned to the customs officers ' booths , the companions of the journey ignored each other . 

<root> Only the man with the flowered sponge-bag , as if unaware of this useful convention , insisted on a Here we are again smile . 

<root> You 're Colonel Bray ? 

<root> He spoke round the obstacle of a woman standing between them . 

<root> Thought I recognized you in Rome . 

<root> Welcome back . 

<root> I must confess I do n't remember you . 

<root> I 've been away a long time . 

<root> The man had long coarse strands of sun-yellowed hair spread from ear to ear across a bald head and wore sunglasses that rested on fine Nordic cheekbones . 

<root> I 've only just come to live here ... from down South . South Africa . 

<root> Who was that I do n't know ... one of the people from the plane ... a baldish fair man with an accent , I did n't catch the name . 

<root> He 'd recently moved up here . 

<root> Oh Hjalmar Wentz must have been . 

<root> He and his wife took over the Silver Rhino last year . 

<root> I like old Hjalmar . 

<root> He 's just been to Denmark or somewhere because his mother died . 

<root> We 'll go in and have a steak there one evening , they 're trying to make a go of it with a charcoal grill and whatnot . 

<root> What happened to McGowan ? 

<root> Good God , they 've been gone at least five or six years . 

<root> There 've been three other managers since then . 

<root> It 's difficult to do anything with that place now ; 

<root> it 's got the character of the miners ' pub it was , but it 's very handy for the new government offices , not too overawing , so you get quite a few Africans coming in . 

<root> A genteel lot , very conscious of their dignity , man-about-town and all that , you can imagine how the white toughies feel about all those white collars round black necks in the bar . 

<root> Hjalmar 's as gentle as a lamb and he has to keep the peace somehow . 

<root> Oh I 'll tell you who 's still around though â€“ Barry Forsyth . 

<root> Yes , and making money . 

<root> Forsyth Construction . You 'll see the board everywhere . 

<root> They tell me he 's got the contract for the whole Isoza River reclamation scheme ... employs engineers from Poland and Italy 

<root> Because of the mosquitoes , they moved into the house . 

<root> The spiders came out from behind the pictures and flattened like starfish against the walls . 

<root> There was no air at all in the living-room , and a strong smell of hot fat . 

<root> Every now and then , while dinner was awaited , their conversation was backed by intensely sociable sounds â€“ pitched talk â€“ let in from the kitchen as the servant went in and out , laying the table . 

<root> There was another large meal , and an exchange about a bottle of white wine between Dando and his cook , Festus . 

<root> Of course I do n't open wrong kind bottle . 

<root> I know when is eat-e chicken , I know when is eat-e beef . 

<root> Well it is the wrong one , because I told you this morning I wanted the round flat bottle put in the fridge . 

<root> You say I cook chicken , is n't it ? 

<root> I look , I see the round bottle is red wine inside ... 

<root> It 's pink . 

<root> I specially did n't say anything about the colour because I did n't want to muddle you up . 

<root> I know how obstinate you are , Festus ... 

<root> They argued self-righteously as two old-maid sisters . 

<root> Festus could be heard retailing the exchange , confidently in the right , in the kitchen ; 

<root> Dando , equally assured , went on talking as if without interruption . 

<root> It 's not an exaggeration to say that what they 're having to do is introduce a so-called democratic social system in place of a paternalist discipline . 

<root> You have n't replaced the District Commissioner by appointing a district magistrate . 

<root> You 've only replaced one of his functions . 

<root> You 've still got to get country people to realize that these functions are now distributed among various agencies : 

<root> it 's no good running to the magistrate if someone needs an ambulance to take him to the next town , for instance ... 

<root> In bush stations there was n't anything we were n't responsible for . 

<root> Exactly . 

<root> But now people have to learn that there 's a Department of Public Health to go to . 

<root> A good thing ! 

<root> A good thing for everybody ! 

<root> What a hopeless business it was , hopeless for the D.C. and for the people . 

<root> Dependency and resentment hand in hand . 

<root> Whatever the black magistrates are like , whatever the administration 's like , it wo n't be like that . 

<root> The magistrates are all right , do n't you worry . 

<root> A damned sight better than some of our fellows . 

<root> I 'm not worried at that level . 

<root> The Bench does n't change of course . 

<root> Bray laughed at Dando 's expression ; 

<root> the look of weary , bottomless distaste in the wrinkled mugs of certain breeds of dogs . 

<root> They 'll die off , I suppose . 

<root> There 's that to be said for it . 

<root> But God knows what we 'll get then . 

<root> I met Gwenzi 's brother in London one day while he was at Gray 's Inn ; 

<root> he told me he was going to be the first African at the bar here . 

<root> When Dando 's opinion of someone was really low he did not seem to hear his name . 

<root> Do n't think I do n't know I 've got some bad times coming to me , he said , as if taking up , in private , current talk about himself . 

<root> When I said yes to Mweta I knew it and every time I walk past the title on my office door I know it . 

<root> The day will come when I 'll have deportation orders to sign that I wo n't want to sign . 

<root> Warrants of arrest . Or worse . 

<root> He ate a mouthful of the left-over granadilla pudding , and there was the smallest tremor , passing for a moment through his head . 

<root> Poor old Dando . 

<root> Anyone who 's stayed on is a fool if he has n't thought about that , said Bray . 

<root> And I 'll be instructing the State Prosecutor to act when I 'd rather not , too . 

<root> That I can count on . 

<root> What if Shinza should make a bit of trouble at the next elections , what if he were to feel himself bloody well discounted as he certainly is , and start up a real opposition with all the tricks that he taught PIP , eh ? 

<root> What if he brought the whole Lambala-speaking crowd out in a boycott , with all the old beatingsup at the polls , hut burnings â€“ you think I would n't find myself the one to put Shinza inside , this time ? 

<root> Well , I know . 

<root> But why on earth should it come to that ? 

<root> I knew it when I said yes to Mweta . 

<root> Poor bloody Dando . 

<root> The blacks ' dirty work is n't any cleaner than the whites ' . 

<root> That 's what they 'll be happy to note . 

<root> But what their contented little minds will never know is that I knew it when I took the job , I knew it all along , and I 'll say it now as loud as I 'd say it then ... 

<root> Who 'll be happy ? 

<root> Dando refilled the brandy glasses again . 

<root> My colleagues ! 

<root> Those worthy fellows who 've gone down South to Rhodesia and South Africa where they can feel confident they 'll never have a black man on the Bench to give a verdict as biased as a white man 's . 

<root> It was after midnight when they got to bed . 

<root> Bray went to the kitchen to fill his brandy glass with water for the night . 

<root> Cockroaches fled , pausing , from what they regarded as positions of safety , to twirl their antennae . 

<root> A furry black band of ants led up a cupboard door to some scrap that had flicked from a plate . 

<root> He stood at the sink , drinking cold water and looking at the avocado pear pip growing suspended by three matchsticks in the neck of a pickle jar of water on the sill . 

<root> He was conscious of a giddy swing of weight from one foot to the other that was not of his volition ; it seemed he had been standing there a long time â€“ he was not sure . 

<root> He heard Dando , forced by the old Labrador into the garden , walking about outside the guest hut and talking reproachfully to the dog ; 

<root> and then it was morning and Festus 's assistant was at the door with the early tea . 

<root> A helicopter snored over the celebrations , drowning the exchange of greetings when Bray was introduced to someone in the street , expunging conversation in bars and even speeches . 

<root> Nobody knew what it was for ... a security measure , some were satisfied to assume , while others accepted it as vaguely appropriate , the symbol of progress inseparable from all industrial fairs and agricultural shows and therefore somehow relevant to any public display . 

<root> There was a moment in the stadium at the actual Independence ceremony when he heard it on the perimeter of the sky just as Kenyatta began to speak , and he and Vivien Bayley , the young wife of the registrar of the new university , sitting beside him , collided glances of alert apprehension ... 

<root> Later it was discovered to have been giving flips at half-a-crown a time to a section of the population who were queueing up , all through the ceremony , at the nearby soccer field ; 

<root> a publicity stunt for an international cigarette-making firm . 

<root> Neil Bayley was the one to find this out , because of some domestic mishap or misunderstanding that made his arrival at the visitors ' stand very late . 

<root> Bray was conscious of furious tension between the young couple at his side as he sat with the great stir of tiers of people behind , and the space in front of him , before the velvet-draped and canopied dais , filled with press photographers and radio and television crews , who all through the solemnities raced about bent double on frantic tiptoe , snaking their wires , thrusting up their contraptions manipulating shutters and flashlights . 

<root> It was as if with all made splendidly ready for a theatrical performance , a party of workmen with their gear had been left behind . 

<root> This activity and the risen temper along the back of a silent quarrel beside him provided the strong distraction of another , disorderly level of being that always seemed to him to take away from planned great moments what they were meant to hold heady and pure . 

<root> Here was the symbolic attainment of something he had believed in , willed and worked for , for a good stretch of his life : 

<root> expressed in the roar that rocked back and forth from the crowd at intervals , the togas , medalled breasts and white gloves , the ululating cries of women , the soldiers at attention , and the sun striking off the clashing brass of the bands . 

<root> Or in the icecream tricycles waiting at the base of each section of an amphitheatre of dark faces , the mongrel that ran out and lifted its leg on the presidential dais ? 

<root> Mweta had the mummified look of one who has become a vessel of ritual . 

<root> But once the declaration of independence was pronounced he came , as out of a trance , to an irresistibly lively self , sitting up there seeing everything around him , a spectator , Bray felt , as well as a spectacle . 

<root> Bray was half-embarrassed to find that he even caught his eye , once , and there was a quick smile ; but Mweta was used to having eyes on him , by now . 

<root> He talked to the elderly English princess who sat beside him with her knees peaked neatly together in the Royal position curiously expressive of the suffering of ceremonies , and Bray saw him point out the contingent of Gala women , their faces and breasts whitened for joy , who were lined up among the troops of musicians and dancers from various regions . 

<root> And yet when that ceremony was over , and in between all the other official occasions â€“ State Ball , receptions , cocktail parties , banquets , and luncheons â€“ a mood of celebration grew up , as it were , outside the palace gates . 

<root> He attended most of the official occasions ( he and Roly saluted each other with mock surprise when they met in the house , half-dressed in formal dinner clothes every night ) but the real parties took place before and after . 

<root> These grew spontaneously one out of the other , and once you had been present at the first , you got handed on to all the others . 

<root> He really knew only some of the people but all of them seemed to know about him , and many were the friends of friends . 

<root> Dando took him to the Bayleys ; but Neil was a friend of Mweta , and Vivien was the niece of , of all people , Sir William Clough , the last governor , who had been a junior with Bray in the colonial service in Tanganyika . 

<root> The Bayleys were friends of Cyprian Kente , Mweta 's Minister of the Interior , and his wife Tindi , and Timothy Odara , one of the territory 's few African doctors , whom Bray , of course , knew well . 

<root> Through each individual the group extended to someone else and drew in , out of the new international character of the little capital , Poles , Ghanaians , Hungarians and Israelis , South African and Rhodesian refugees . 

<root> After the State Ball there was a private all-night party in a marquee . 

<root> Roly Dando had promised to drop by , and of course Bray was with him . 

<root> Cheers went up from the people already present who had not been at the ball ; they had decided to dress for once , too , and the two groups of women mingled and exclaimed over each other , everyone began to talk about what the ball was like , champagne came in , a Congolese band whipped up their pace , and the absurd and slightly thrilling mood of the State Ball and the cosy gaiety of the party swept together . 

<root> The tent was filled with chairs and divans borrowed from people 's houses , and flowers from their gardens . 

<root> Someone had put up a board with a collage of blown-up pictures of Mweta â€“ speaking , laughing , yawning , touching a piece of machinery with curiosity , leaving , arriving , even threatening . 

<root> Many other people Bray had seen at the ball streamed in in their finery : 

<root> they had contributed to the arrangements for this party . 

<root> The trouble everyone had taken gave a sense of occasion to even the wildest moments of the night . 

<root> Vivien Bayley , queenly at twenty-six , with her beautiful , well-mannered , disciplined face , came to hover beside Bray between responsible permutations about the room to make sure that this young girl was not being bothered too much by the attentions of someone older and rather drunk , or that young man was not being overlooked by the girls who ought to be taking notice of him . 

<root> Bray surprised her by asking her to dance , swaying stiffly to a rhythm he did n't know , but nevertheless keeping the beat , so that they would n't make fools of themselves among the complicated gyrations of the Africans . 

<root> I 'm so glad you dance , she said ; he was ashamed that he had asked her only out of politeness . 

<root> Neil wo n't ... I think it 's a mistake to let oneself forget these things because of vanity . 

<root> Tindi Kente is a wonderful dancer , wonderful , is n't she ... just like a snake brought out by music , and sometimes he 'll try with her . 

<root> He loves to flirt with her when Cyprian 's not looking , but get her doing her marvellous wriggle on the floor and he just stands there like Andrew , dragging his feet . 

<root> Andrew was probably one of her children ; 

<root> being accepted with such immediate casual friendliness by everyone was rather like being forced to learn a foreign language by finding oneself alone among people who spoke nothing else : 

<root> it was assumed that he would pick up family and other relationships merely by being exposed to them . 

<root> Someone called to Vivien and they were drawn away from the dancers to a crowded table . 

<root> A young woman leaned her elbows on it and her white breasts pursed forward within the frame of her arms . 

<root> Have my glass , she said , as there were no spare ones to go round . 

<root> She went off to dance , holding in her stomach as she squeezed past and balanced her soft-looking body . 

<root> The heat was heightened by drink and animation and the glass filled by the long , narrow black hand of his neighbour was marked by the fingerprints of the white woman who had relinquished it . 

<root> You do n't remember me ? 

<root> Ras Asahe , I came to your place in England once . 

<root> The young man said he was in broadcasting now , so-called assistant to the Director of English Language Services . 

<root> And how 's your father ? 

<root> Good Lord , I 'd like to see him again ! 

<root> Joseph Asahe was one of Edward Shinza 's lieutenants in the early days of PIP . 

<root> He 's old now . 

<root> It was not the right question to have asked ; 

<root> what the young man dismissed was any possible suggestion that he was to be thought of in connection with Shinza . 

<root> His clothes , watch , cufflinks were those of a man who feels he must buy the best for himself , he had the Mussolini-jaw quite common among the people in the part of the country he came from but those hands were the lyrical , delicately strong , African ones that escaped the international blandness of businessmen 's hands as Bray had marvelled to see them escape the brutalizing of physical hardship . 

<root> Convicts broke stones with hands like that , here . 

<root> They made conversation about the radio and television coverage of the celebrations , and from this broke into talk that interested them both : 

<root> the problem of communication in a country with so many different language groups . 

<root> I wonder how much use could be made of a radio classroom in country schools , whether it could n't help considerably to ease the shortage of teachers , here , and maintain some sort of standard where teachers are perhaps not very well qualified . 

<root> I 'd like to talk to somebody about it ... your man ? 

<root> I 'm not keen to go straight to the Director-General ... 

<root> It wo n't make much difference . 

<root> They laughed at him again . 

<root> Everyone was gathering round for servings from the roast sheep , and the fair stocky man from the airport signalled a greeting with a piece of meat in his fingers . 

<root> Wentz , Hjalmar Wentz , we met on the plane . 

<root> Roland Dando said we probably should be seeing you at the Rhino . 

<root> They moved off with their plates of food , and Wentz said to a woman settled in one of the canvas chairs , Margot , here is Colonel Bray . 

<root> No , no , please stay where you are . 

<root> In the fuss to find somewhere to sit he saw the light of the fire under the spit running along the shiny planes of the woman 's face as it did on glasses and the movement of knives and forks . 

<root> Bright hair was brushed up off a high round forehead and behind the ears , in a way he associated with busy , capable women . 

<root> Try some , Margot , it 's wonderful ... 

<root> Are n't I fat enough ... 

<root> But she took a tidbit of crisp fat from her husband 's fork . 

<root> To tell the truth , this 's the first time for a week we 've had time to sit down to eat . 

<root> Margot 's had to be in the kitchen herself from six in the morning , and some nights it 's been until ten . 

<root> She literally has n't sat down to a meal ... 

<root> Oh , not quite ... I must have had hundreds of cups of coffee . 

<root> Yes , with one hand while you were busy stirring a pot with the other . 

<root> The cook went to the Independence ceremony and we have n't seen him since ... just for the afternoon , he said , just to see the great men he 's seen in the papers ... well , what can you say ? 

<root> We felt it was his day , after all . 

<root> The woman showed a wellshaped smile in the dark . 

<root> Bray asked , How on earth have you managed ? 

<root> She gestured and laughed , but her husband was eager to break in , holding up his hands over the plate balanced on his knees . 

<root> A hundred and twenty-two for dinner ! 

<root> That 's what it was on Thursday . And yesterday ... Only a hundred and nine , that 's all ... 

<root> They laughed . 

<root> Bray raised his beer mug of wine to her . 

<root> What about my assistant cook ? 

<root> You must n't forget I 've got help , she said . 

<root> Wentz put down his glass beside his chair , to do the justice of full attention to what he was going to say . 

<root> Her assistant cook . 

<root> I got him from the new labour exchange â€“ I thought , well , let 's try it , so they send him along , five years ' experience , everything fine . 

<root> His wife was listening , laughing softly , sitting back majestically for a moment . 

<root> Five years ' experience , but d' you know what as ? 

<root> You know the barbers under the mango trees there just before you get to the second-class trading area ? 

<root> Our son 's comment was the best , I think . 

<root> Well , here 's to three crazy people , said Wentz , excitedly picking up his glass . 

<root> Everyone knows you must be crazy to come of your own free will to one of these countries . 

<root> Colonel Bray is n't going to run a hotel . 

<root> She had a soft , dry voice and her accent was slighter than her husband 's . 

<root> I 'm not as brave as you are . 

<root> Oh , how do you know ? said Wentz . 

<root> We did n't know what we were going to land up doing , either . 

<root> She said quietly , We certainly did n't think we 'd be the proprietors of the Silver Rhino . 

<root> Anyway , that 's another story , said Wentz . 

<root> Oh , did you ? he laughed . 

<root> Well , perhaps I am , then . 

<root> I should think the bar of the Silver Rhino 's as good a place as any to learn what 's really going on . 

<root> If you want to hear how much ugliness there is â€“ yes . 

<root> Mrs. Wentz had the tone of voice that sounds as if the speaker is addressing noone but himself . 

<root> How people still think with their blood and enjoy to contempt ... yes , the bar at the Silver Rhino . 

<root> Our son Stephen is looking after it tonight . 

<root> It 's amazing how he deals with those fellows â€“ better than I do , I can tell you . 

<root> He keeps them in place . 

<root> We promised him a liberal education when we left South Africa , you see . 

<root> Mrs. Wentz had put down her food and she sat back out of the light of the fire , a big face glimmering in the dark , caverns where the eyes were . 

<root> taking the A levels , said Wentz , innocently . 

<root> You 're not going to finish ? 

<root> The white blur of her hand moved in a gesture of rejection ... 

<root> You have it , Hjalmar . 

<root> It rained and people felt chilly on the veranda and drifted indoors . 

<root> There was a group in loud discussion round the empty fireplace where the beer bottles were stacked ... 

<root> banging on the Governor 's door with a panga when the others were still picannins with snotty noses ... 

<root> Now Dando had the sulky outraged attention of a young patriot from the social welfare department , the glittering-eyed indifference of Doris Manyema , one of the country 's three or four women graduates , and the amused appreciation of a South African refugee whose yellow-brown colour , small nose and fine lips set him apart from the blackness of the other two . 

<root> In the light , Margot Wentz 's head was the figurehead of a ship above the hulk of her body : 

<root> a double-chinned , handsome dark blonde , the short high nose coming from the magnificent forehead , water-coloured eyes underlined with cuts of fatigue deep into each cheek . 

<root> With an absent smile to Bray across the room , she took up , for a moment , an abandoned beauty . 

<root> When he joined the group , they were listening to her . 

<root> We do n't have to argue ; we can take it that colonialism is indefensible , for us , no ? 

<root> You think so , I think so ... right . 

<root> Timothy Odara 's eyes were closed ; leaning against the wall he kept his lips drawn back slightly , alert . 

<root> I 'm sorry , forty-eight years you were under British rule , digging their mines , building roads for them , making towns , living in shanties and waiting on them , cleaning up after them , treated like dirt ... now it 's all over , you really think there was any way at all you could enter the modern world without suffering ? 

<root> You think there was someone else would have given you the alphabet ! and electricity and killed off the malaria mosquito , just for love ? 

<root> The Finns ? The Russians ? Anybody ? 

<root> Anyone who would n't have wanted the last drop of your sweat and pride in return ? 

<root> These are the facts . 

<root> From your point of view , as it luckily lasted less than two generations . Was n't it worth it ? 

<root> Would anybody have let you in for nothing ? 

<root> Anybody at all ? 

<root> That 's what I 'm asking ... 

<root> Would n't you have to pay the price in suffering ? 

<root> Oh you make the usual mistake of seeing the life of the African people as a blank ... and then the colonialists come along and we come to life â€“ in your compounds and back yards . 

<root> She was shaking her head slowly while Odara was speaking . 

<root> All I 'm saying , do n't wear the sufferings of the past round your necks . 

<root> What does independence mean â€“ I do n't use freedom , I do n't like the big words â€“ what does your independence mean , then ? 

<root> The past is useful for political purposes only said Hjalmar , as he might have said : she 's right . 

<root> Someone said , Watch out for the man from the CIA . 

<root> Down with neo-colonialism . 

<root> Of course , Curtis , said Hjalmar . 

<root> But if you have to do it by keeping that forty years or whatever sitting at the table with you and your children ... ach , it 's not healthy , it makes me sick . 

<root> What do they want to hear how you had to go round to the back door of the missionary 's house ? 

<root> Mrs. Odara had joined the group , running a big , silver-nailed hand through Curtis Pettigrew 's crew-cut hair . 

<root> Oh God , Timothy , not that again . 

<root> Odara laughed . 

<root> But it always comes down to the same thing : you Europeans talk very reasonably about that sort of suffering because you do n't know ... you may have thought it was terrible , but there 's nothing like that in your lives . 

<root> Bray saw Margot Wentz put up her head with a quick grimace-smile , as if someone had told an old joke she could n't raise a laugh for . 

<root> Well , here you 're mistaken , her husband said , rather grandly , we lived under Mr. Hitler . 

<root> And you must know all about that . 

<root> I 'm not interested in Hitler . 

<root> Timothy Odara 's fine teeth were bared in impatient pleasantness . 

<root> My friend , white men have killed more people in Africa than Hitler ever did in Europe . 

<root> But you 're crazy , said Wentz gently . 

<root> Europe 's wars , white men 's killings among themselves . What 's that to me ? 

<root> You 've just said one should n't burden oneself with suffering . 

<root> I do n't have any feelings about Hitler . 

<root> Oh but you should , Mrs. Wentz said , almost dreaming . 

<root> No more and no less than you do about what happened to Africans . 

<root> It 's all the same thing . 

<root> A slave in the hold of a ship in the eighteenth century and a Jew or a gipsy in a concentration camp in the nineteen-forties . 

<root> Well , I had my seventeenth and eighteenth birthdays in the detention camp at Fort Howard , the guest of Her Majesty 's governor , said Odara , that I know . 

<root> Her two brothers died at Auschwitz , Hjalmar Wentz said ; 

<root> but his wife was talking to Jo-Ann Pettigrew , who offered blobs of toasted marshmallow on the end of a long fork . 

<root> For God 's sake , Timothy , stop baring your teeth and sink them into something . 

<root> Evelyn Odara spoke to her husband as no local woman would dare ; yet he ignored it , as if turning the tables on her with his countrymen 's assumption that what women said was not heard , anyway . 

<root> He said angrily to Wentz , directing the remark at the wife through the husband , What did you get in return that was worth it ? 

<root> Margot Wentz said , looking at no one , That one ca n't say . 

<root> She waggled her fingers , sticky from the marshmallow , and her husband took his handkerchief from his pocket and gave it to her . 

<root> It was the evening when Bray , Neil , Evelyn Odara , one of the South African refugees , the Pettigrews , and a few others set off for the Sputnik Bar . 

<root> While Bray was standing about in the group with the Odaras and the Wentzes , Jo-Ann Pettigrew , having failed to get him to eat her last marshmallow , put it in her mouth and signalled to everyone there was something they must hear . 

<root> Rebecca 's been to the Sputnik and she says it 's terrific now . 

<root> They 've knocked out a wall into that sort of yard thing and they have dancing . 

<root> With girls laid on . 

<root> Neil said , Hey ? 

<root> And which one of us 's been taking Rebecca to the Sputnik ? 

<root> Laughter rose . 

<root> Well , why do n't we all go , that 's what I want t' know . 

<root> The young Pettigrew woman was always in a state of enthusiasm ; 

<root> her long curly hair had sprung out , diademed with raindrops , because she had done her marshmallow toasting outside over the spit fire . 

<root> She was an anthropologist , and Bray accepted this as an explanation for her passion for arranging excursions , on which she carried her baby tied on her back , African style . 

<root> Who was it ? 

<root> There was a roar again . 

<root> No , no â€“ well , Ras took her ... 

<root> Oh Ras , was it ? 

<root> Sputnik Bar , eh ? 

<root> So that 's it , now . 

<root> Rebecca Edwards came in from the veranda , smiling good-naturedly , inquiringly , under the remarks shied at her . 

<root> She said , There 're bulbs like you see in films round the star 's dressing-table , and they light up and spell INDEPENDENCE HURRAH . 

<root> In great confusion , there and then they decided to go . 

<root> Dando refused and Vivien had to go home to the children , and Rebecca Edwards protested that hers were alone too . 

<root> Neil insisted that Bray must come ; 

<root> he was one of those people who , late at night , suddenly have a desperate need of certain companions . 

<root> But when Neil , Bray , Evelyn Odara and the South African got down to the second-class trading area , the others had n't arrived . 

<root> They went into the Sputnik Bar for a moment , meeting music like a buffeting about the head , and then someone said that he thought the arrangement had been to meet at the railway crossing . 

<root> There began one of those chases about in the night that , Bray saw , Neil Bayley fiercely enjoyed . 

<root> They went all the way back into town to the flats where the Edwards girl lived ... 

<root> Neil stood on the moonlit patch of earth in front of the dark building and called up , but there was no response . 

<root> They stopped somewhere to give a man a lift ; he was caught in the lights , hat in hand ; only his clean white shirt had shown on the dark road . 

<root> He answered Neil with a liberal use of Bwana , as a white man would expect if he were to do such a thing as stop for a black one on the road , and when he got into the car beside Bray and the South African , sat among these black and white city people like a hedgehog rolled into itself at a touch . 

<root> Bray , back in this country once more , again aware of his own height and size and pinkness almost like some form of aggression he was n't responsible for , knew that the fellow was holding himself away from contact with him . 

<root> The voices of Evelyn , Neil , and the South African flew about the car ; 

<root> they passed the shadows of the mango trees in the bright moonlight lying beneath the trees like sleeping beasts ; 

<root> a donkey cropping among broken china on a refuse mound ; 

<root> the colours on the mosque almost visible , the silvered burglar grilles on the elaborate houses of the Indian sector . 

<root> The second-class trading area had been laid out long ago and haphazardly ; shops cropped up suddenly , streets met , the car plunged and rolled . 

<root> THE WORST BIRTHDAY 

<root> Not for the first time , an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four , Privet Drive . 

<root> Mr Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud , hooting noise from his nephew Harry 's room . 

<root> Harry tried , yet again , to explain . 

<root> If I could just let her out at night â€“ 

<root> He exchanged dark looks with his wife , Petunia . 

<root> Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long , loud belch from the Dursleys son , Dudley . 

<root> We must feed you up while we 've got the chance . I do n't like the sound of that school food 

<root> Dudley , who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair , grinned and turned to Harry . 

<root> The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible : Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen ; Mrs Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth ; Mr Dursley jumped to his feet , veins throbbing in his temples . 

<root> I meant " please " ! said Harry quickly . 

<root> Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt , who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet . 

<root> Uncle Vernon sat back down , breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small , sharp eyes . 

<root> ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays , Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment , because Harry Potter was n't a normal boy . 

<root> As a matter of fact , he was as not normal as it is possible to be . 

<root> Harry Potter was a wizard â€“ a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 

<root> And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays , it was nothing to how Harry felt . 

<root> He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomach ache . 

<root> All Harry 's spellbooks , his wand , robes , cauldron and top-of-the-range Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home . 

<root> What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place in the house Quidditch team because he had n't practised all summer ? 

<root> What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done ? 

<root> The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles ( not a drop of magical blood in their veins ) and as far as they were concerned , having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame . 

<root> Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry 's owl , Hedwig , inside her cage , to stop her carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world . 

<root> Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family . 

<root> Uncle Vernon was large and neckless , with an enormous black moustache ; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony ; Dudley was blond , pink and porky . 

<root> Harry , on the other hand , was small and skinny , with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy . 

<root> He wore round glasses , and on his forehead was a thin , lightning-shaped scar . 

<root> It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual , even for a wizard . 

<root> This scar was the only hint of Harry 's very mysterious past , of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys doorstep eleven years before . 

<root> At the age of one , Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time , Lord Voldemort , whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak . 

<root> Harry 's parents had died in Voldemort 's attack , but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar , and somehow â€“ nobody understood why â€“ Voldemort 's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry . 

<root> So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother 's sister and her husband . 

<root> He had spent ten years with the Dursleys , never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to , believing the Dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash which had killed his parents . 

<root> And then , exactly a year ago , Hogwarts had written to Harry , and the whole story had come out . 

<root> Harry had taken up his place at wizard school , where he and his scar were famous , but now the school year was over , and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer , back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly . 

<root> The Dursleys had n't even remembered that today happened to be Harry 's twelfth birthday . 

<root> of course , his hopes had n't been high ; they 'd never given him a proper present , let alone a cake â€“ but to ignore it completely . 

<root> Harry looked up , hardly daring to believe it . 

<root> This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career , said Uncle Vernon . 

<root> Harry went back to his toast . 

<root> of course , he thought bitterly , Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party . 

<root> He 'd been talking of nothing else for a fortnight . 

<root> Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him ( Uncle Vernon 's company made drills ) . 

<root> Good , good . 

<root> Dudley put on a foul , simpering smile . 

<root> Excellent , Dudley , said Uncle Vernon . 

<root> Then he rounded on Harry . 

<root> At eight fifteen â€“ 

<root> And you ? said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry . 

<root> Now , we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner . 

<root> Do tell me where you bought your dress , Mrs Mason 

<root> This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry . 

<root> Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son , while Harry ducked under the table so they would n't see him laughing . 

<root> Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged . 

<root> Too right you will , said Uncle Vernon forcefully . 

<root> When dinner 's over , you take Mrs Mason back to the lounge for coffee , Petunia , and I 'll bring the subject round to drills . 

<root> With any luck , I 'll have the deal signed and sealed before the News at Ten . 

<root> Harry could n't feel too excited about this . 

<root> He did n't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did in Privet Drive . 

<root> Harry left through the back door . 

<root> It was a brilliant , sunny day . 

<root> He crossed the lawn , slumped down on the garden bench , and sang under his breath : " Happy birthday to me . happy birthday to me " 

<root> No cards , no presents , and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist . 

<root> He gazed miserably into the hedge . 

<root> He had never felt so lonely . 

<root> More than anything else at Hogwarts , more even than playing Quidditch , Harry missed his best friends , Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger . 

<root> They , however , did n't seem to be missing him at all . 

<root> Neither of them had written to him all summer , even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay . 

<root> Countless times , Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig 's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter , but it was n't worth the risk . 

<root> Underage wizards were n't allowed to use magic outside school . 

<root> Harry had n't told the Dursleys this ; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick . 

<root> For the first couple of weeks back , Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him . 

<root> But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal â€“ and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday . 

<root> What would n't he give now for a message from Hogwarts ? 

<root> From any witch or wizard ? 

<root> He 'd almost be glad of a sight of his arch-enemy , Draco Malfoy , just to be sure it had n't all been a dream . 

<root> Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun . 

<root> At the very end of last term , Harry had come face to face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself . 

<root> Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self , but he was still terrifying , still cunning , still determined to regain power . 

<root> Harry had slipped through Voldemort 's clutches for a second time , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyes . 

<root> Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench . 

<root> He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge â€“ and the hedge was staring back . 

<root> Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves . 

<root> Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn . 

<root> The huge eyes blinked and vanished . 

<root> So you 've finally learned the days of the week . 

<root> Dudley hitched up his trousers , which were slipping down his fat bottom . 

<root> Why 're you staring at the hedge ? he said suspiciously . 

<root> Dudley stumbled backwards at once , a look of panic on his fat face . 

<root> MUUUUUUM ! howled Dudley , tripping over his feet as he dashed back towards the house . 

<root> Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun . 

<root> As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt , Aunt Petunia knew he had n't really done magic , but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan . 

<root> Then she gave him work to do , with the promise he would n't eat again until he 'd finished . 

<root> While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams , Harry cleaned the windows , washed the car , mowed the lawn , trimmed the flowerbeds , pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench . 

<root> The sun blazed overhead , burning the back of his neck . 

<root> Harry knew he should n't have risen to Dudley 's bait , but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself maybe he did n't have any friends at Hogwarts 

<root> Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely , as he spread manure on the flower beds , his back aching , sweat running down his face . 

<root> Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen . 

<root> On top of the fridge stood tonight 's pudding : a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets . 

<root> A joint of roast pork was sizzling in the oven . 

<root> Eat quickly ! 

<root> She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress . 

<root> Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper . 

<root> The moment he had finished , Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate . 

<root> As he passed the door to the living room , Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow-ties and dinner jackets . 

<root> He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon 's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs . 

<root> Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe , slipped inside , closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed . 

<root> The trouble was , there was already someone sitting on it . 

<root> Harry managed not to shout out , but it was a close thing . 

<root> The little creature on the bed had large , bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls . 

<root> Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning . 

<root> As they stared at each other , Harry heard Dudley 's voice from the hall . 

<root> May I take your coats , Mr and Mrs Mason ? 

<root> The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet . 

<root> Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase , with rips for arm and leg holes . 

<root> Th-thank you , said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair , next to Hedwig , who was asleep in her large cage . 

<root> Just Dobby . 

<root> Er â€“ I do n't want to be rude or anything , but â€“ this is n't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom . 

<root> Aunt Petunias high , false laugh sounded from the living room . 

<root> The elf hung his head . 

<root> People goggled through the bars at him as he lay , starving and weak , on a bed of straw . 

<root> Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage , laughing at him . 

<root> Leave me alone . Cut it out . I 'm trying to sleep . 

<root> He opened his eyes . 

<root> Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window . 

<root> And someone was goggling through the bars at him : a freckle-faced , red-haired , long-nosed someone . 

<root> Ron Weasley was outside Harry 's window . 

<root> Harry 's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him . 

<root> Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car , which was parked in mid-air . 

<root> Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George , Ron 's elder twin brothers . 

<root> Why have n't you been answering my letters ? 

<root> Bit rich coming from you , said Harry , staring at the floating car . 

<root> Stop gibbering , said Ron , we 've come to take you home with us . 

<root> If the Dursleys wake up , I 'm dead , said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car . 

<root> Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig , who seemed to have realised how important this was and kept still and silent . 

<root> The car revved louder and louder and suddenly , with a crunching noise , the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air â€“ Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground . 

<root> Panting , Ron hoisted them up into the car . 

<root> Harry listened anxiously , but there was no sound from the Dursleys bedroom . 

<root> When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron , Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry 's window . 

<root> Locked in the cupboard under the stairs , and I ca n't get out of this room â€“ 

<root> Fred and George climbed carefully through the window into Harry 's room . 

<root> You had to hand it to them , thought Harry , as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock . 

<root> There was a small click and the door swung open . 

<root> Watch out for the bottom stair , it creaks , Harry whispered back , as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing . 

<root> Harry dashed around his room , collecting his things together and passing them out of the window to Ron . 

<root> Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs . 

<root> Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough . 

<root> At last , panting , they reached the landing , then carried the trunk through Harry 's room to the open window . 

<root> Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron , and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side . 

<root> Inch by inch , the trunk slid through the window . 

<root> Uncle Vernon coughed again . 

<root> Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car . 

<root> But as Harry climbed onto the window-sill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him , followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon 's voice . 

<root> Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on . 

<root> He snatched up Hedwig 's cage , dashed to the window and passed it out to Ron . 

<root> He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door â€“ and it crashed open . 

<root> For a split second , Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway ; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry , grabbing him by the ankle . 

<root> Ron , Fred and George seized Harry 's arms and pulled as hard as they could . 

<root> Petunia ! roared Uncle Vernon . 

<root> But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry 's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon 's grasp . 

<root> Harry could n't believe it â€“ he was free . 

<root> He wound down the window , the night air whipping his hair , and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive . 

<root> Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley were all hanging , dumbstruck , out of Harry 's window . 

<root> The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning from ear to ear . 

<root> Let Hedwig out , he told Ron . She can fly behind us . 

<root> George handed the hairpin to Ron and a moment later , Hedwig had soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost . 

<root> Harry told them all about Dobby , the warning he 'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding . 

<root> There was a long shocked silence when he had finished . 

<root> " Definitely dodgy " agreed George . 

<root> He saw Fred and George look at each other . 

<root> Well , said Fred , put it this way â€“ house-elves have got powerful magic of their own , but they ca n't usually use it without their master 's permission . 

<root> I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts . 

<root> Someone 's idea of a joke . 

<root> Draco Malfoy ? said George , turning around . 

<root> He was a big supporter of You Know Who . 

<root> Harry had heard these rumours about Malfoy 's family before , and they did n't surprise him at all . 

<root> Draco Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind , thoughtful and sensitive boy . 

<root> Yeah , Mum 's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing , said George . 

<root> Harry was silent . 

<root> Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything , his family were rolling in wizard gold ; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house . 

<root> Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do . 

<root> Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously ? 

<root> I thought it was Errol 's fault at first â€“ 

<root> He 's ancient . 

<root> It would n't be the first time he 'd collapsed on a delivery . 

<root> The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made a prefect , said Fred from the front . 

<root> I mean , there 's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge . 

<root> You 're driving too far west , Fred , he added , pointing at a compass on the dashboard . 

<root> Fred twiddled the steering wheel . 

<root> He works in the most boring department , said Ron . 

<root> Like , last year , some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop . 

<root> This Muggle woman bought it , took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it . 

<root> What happened ? 

<root> Fred laughed . 

<root> He takes it apart , puts spells on it and puts it back together again . 

<root> If he raided our house he 'd have to put himself straight under arrest . 

<root> It drives Mum mad . 

<root> A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east . 

<root> Fred brought the car lower and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees . 

<root> Lower and lower went the flying car . 

<root> The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees . 

<root> Touchdown ! said Fred as , with a slight bump , they hit the ground . 

<root> They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron 's house . 

<root> It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigsty , but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several storeys high and so crooked it looked as though it was held up by magic ( which , Harry reminded himself , it probably was ) . 

<root> Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof . 

<root> Round the front door lay a jumble of wellington boots and a very rusty cauldron . 

<root> Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard . 

<root> They got out of the car . 

<root> Then , Ron , you come bounding downstairs going , Mum , look who turned up in the night ! and she 'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car . 

<root> Ron had gone a nasty greenish colour , his eyes fixed on the house . 

<root> The other three wheeled around . 

<root> Mrs Weasley was marching across the yard , scattering chickens , and for a short , plump , kind-faced woman , it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger . 

<root> Mrs Weasley came to a halt in front of them , her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next . 

<root> She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket . 

<root> So , she said . 

<root> All three of Mrs Weasley 's sons were taller than she was , but they cowered as her rage broke over them . 

<root> No note ! 

<root> Car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care ? never , as long as I 've lived you wait until your father gets home , we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy 

<root> It seemed to go on for hours . 

<root> Mrs Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry , who backed away . 

<root> Come in and have some breakfast . 

<root> She turned and walked back into the house and Harry , after a nervous glance at Ron , who nodded encouragingly , followed her . 

<root> The kitchen was small and rather cramped . 

<root> There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat , looking around . 

<root> He had never been in a wizard house before . 

<root> The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all . 

<root> Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece , books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese , Enchantment in Baking , and One Minute Feasts â€“ It 's Magic ! 

<root> Mrs Weasley was clattering around , cooking breakfast a little haphazardly , throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan . 

<root> Arthur and I have been worried about you , too . 

<root> Just last night we were saying we 'd come and get you ourselves if you had n't written back to Ron by Friday . 

<root> She flicked her wand casually at the washing-up in the sink , which began to clean itself , clinking gently in the background . 

<root> and you ! said Mrs Weasley , but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him . 

<root> At that moment , there was a diversion in the form of a small , red-headed figure in a long nightdress , who appeared in the kitchen , gave a small squeal , and ran out again . 

<root> Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean , which took a surprisingly short time . 

<root> Blimey , I 'm tired , yawned Fred , setting down his knife and fork at last . 

<root> Oh , Mum â€“ 

<root> That 's very sweet of you , dear , but it 's dull work , said Mrs Weasley . 

<root> And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece . 

<root> George groaned . 

<root> Harry looked at the cover of Mrs Weasley 's book . 

<root> Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words : Gilderoy Lockhart 's Guide to Household Pests . 

<root> He 'll be fine , Molly , do n't fuss , said Mr Weasley , helping himself to Floo powder , too . 

<root> Now , when you get into the fire , say where you 're going â€“ 

<root> Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace â€“ 

<root> Trying hard to bear all this in mind , Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire . 

<root> He took a deep breath , scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward ; the fire felt like a warm breeze ; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash . 

<root> It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant plug hole . 

<root> He seemed to be spinning very fast 

<root> the roaring in his ears was deafening 

<root> he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick 

<root> something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly , still spinning and spinning 

<root> now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face 

<root> squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond 

<root> his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him . 

<root> He closed his eyes again wishing it would stop , and then â€“ he fell , face forward , onto cold stone and felt his glasses shatter . 

<root> Dizzy and bruised , covered in soot , he got gingerly to his feet , holding his broken glasses up to his eyes . 

<root> He was quite alone , but where he was , he had no idea . 

<root> All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large , dimly lit wizard 's shop â€“ but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list . 

<root> A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion , a blood-stained pack of cards , and a staring glass eye . 

<root> Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls , an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter , and rusty , spiked instruments hung from the ceiling . 

<root> Even worse , the dark , narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley . 

<root> The sooner he got out of here , the better . 

<root> Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left ; he shot inside it and pulled the doors to leaving a small crack to peer through . 

<root> Seconds later , a bell clanged , and Malfoy stepped into the shop . 

<root> The man who followed could only be his father . 

<root> He had the same pale , pointed face and identical cold grey eyes . 

<root> I said I would buy you a racing broom , said his father , drumming his fingers on the counter . 

<root> Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor . 

<root> Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls . 

<root> A stooping man had appeared behind the counter , smoothing his greasy hair back from his face . 

<root> Mr Malfoy , what a pleasure to see you again , said Mr Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair . 

<root> How may I be of assistance ? 

<root> The smile faded slightly from Mr Borgin 's face . 

<root> You have heard , of course , that the Ministry is conducting more raids , said Mr Malfoy , taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unravelling it for Mr Borgin to read . 

<root> Mr Borgin fixed a pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list . 

<root> Mr Malfoy 's lip curled . 

<root> The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect , yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome . 

<root> Harry felt a hot surge of anger . 

<root> â€“ and as you see , certain of these poisons might make it appear â€“ 

<root> Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder ! 

<root> Best friend of thieves and plunderers ! 

<root> The teachers all have favourites , that Hermione Granger â€“ 

<root> Not with me , said Mr Malfoy , his long nostrils flaring . 

<root> They started to haggle . 

<root> Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place , examining the objects for sale . 

<root> He paused to examine a long coil of hangman 's rope and to read , smirking , the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals : 

<root> Caution : Do Not Touch . 

<root> Cursed â€“ Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date . 

<root> Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him . 

<root> He walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle 

<root> Come , Draco ! 

<root> Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away . 

<root> The moment the door had closed , Mr Borgin dropped his oily manner . 

<root> Muttering darkly , Mr Borgin disappeared into a back room . 

<root> Harry waited for a minute in case he came back , then , quietly as he could , slipped out of the cabinet , past the glass cases , and out of the shop door . 

<root> Clutching his broken glasses to his face he stared around . 

<root> He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts . 

<root> The one he 'd just left , Borgin and Burkes , looked like the largest , but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads , and two doors down , a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders . 

<root> Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway , muttering to each other . 

<root> Feeling jumpy , Harry set off , trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he 'd be able to find a way out of there . 

<root> An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley . 

<root> This did n't help , as Harry had never heard of such a place . 

<root> He supposed he had n't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys fire . 

<root> Trying to stay calm , he wondered what to do . 

<root> An aged witch stood in front of him , holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails . 

<root> She leered at him , showing mossy teeth . 

<root> Harry backed away . 

<root> I 'm just â€“ 

<root> Harry 's heart leapt . 

<root> Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch , knocking the tray right out of her hands . 

<root> Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight . 

<root> Harry saw a familiar , snow-white marble building in the distance : Gringotts Bank . 

<root> Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley . 

<root> Yer a mess ! said Hagrid gruffly , brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary 's . 

<root> They 're ruinin' the school cabbages . 

<root> They set off together down the street . 

<root> Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys . 

<root> Ruddy Muggles , growled Hagrid . 

<root> Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts . 

<root> She ran down to meet them , her bushy brown hair flying behind her . 

<root> Hello , Hagrid 

<root> Oh , it 's wonderful to see you two again 

<root> Are you coming into Gringotts , Harry ? 

<root> Harry and Hermione looked around : sprinting up the crowded street were Ron , Fred , George , Percy and Mr Weasley . 

<root> He mopped his glistening bald patch . 

<root> Molly 's frantic â€“ she 's coming now . 

<root> I should ruddy well think not , growled Hagrid . 

<root> Mrs Weasley now came galloping into view , her handbag swinging wildly in one hand , Ginny just clinging onto the other . 

<root> Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid had n't managed to beat away . 

<root> Mr Weasley took Harry 's glasses , gave them a tap of his wand and returned them , good as new . 

<root> And he strode away , head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street . 

<root> Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes ? Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps . 

<root> Oh , I 'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something 

<root> What 's that you 've got there ? 

<root> Oh , you 're changing Muggle money . 

<root> Molly , look ! 

<root> He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr Granger 's hand . 

<root> The vaults were reached by means of small , goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train-tracks through the bank 's underground tunnels . 

<root> Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys vault , but felt dreadful , far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley , when it was opened . 

<root> There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside , and just one gold Galleon . 

<root> Mrs Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag . 

<root> Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault . 

<root> He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag . 

<root> Back outside on the marble steps , they all separated . 

<root> Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill . 

<root> Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts , Lee Jordan . 

<root> Mrs Weasley and Ginny were going to a second-hand robe shop . Mr Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink . 

<root> Harry , Ron and Hermione strolled off along the winding , cobbled street . 

<root> The bag of gold , silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry 's pocket was clamouring to be spent , so he bought three large strawberry and peanut-butter ice-creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley , examining the fascinating shop windows . 

<root> A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers , Ron read aloud off the back cover . 

<root> An hour later , they headed for Flourish and Blotts . 

<root> They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop . 

<root> As they approached it , they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors , trying to get in . 

<root> The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows : 

<root> GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 to 4:30 pm . 

<root> I mean , he 's written almost the whole booklist ! 

<root> Harry , Ron , and Hermione squeezed inside . 

<root> A long line wound right to the back of the shop , where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books . 

<root> They each grabbed a copy of Break with a Banshee , and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr and Mrs Granger . 

<root> She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair . 

<root> Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view , seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face , all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd . 

<root> The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue which exactly matched his eyes ; his pointed wizard 's hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair . 

<root> A short , irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash .
