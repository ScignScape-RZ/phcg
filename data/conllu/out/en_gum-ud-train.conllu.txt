<root> How do people look at and experience art ? 

<root> Which elements of specific artworks do they focus on ? 

<root> Do museum labels have an impact on how people look at artworks ? 

<root> The viewing experience of art is a complex one , involving issues of perception , attention , memory , decision-making , affect , and emotion . 

<root> Thus , the time it takes and the ways of visually exploring an artwork can inform about its relevance , interestingness , and even its aesthetic appeal . 

<root> This paper describes a collaborative pilot project focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings . 

<root> The Jacob cycle at Auckland Castle is the only UK example of a continental collection preserved in situ in purpose-built surroundings . 

<root> While studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics , no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes . 

<root> In this paper , we report upon the novel insights eye-tracking techniques have provided into the unconscious processes of viewing the unique collection of Zurbarán artworks . 

<root> The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks . 

<root> We will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our understanding of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice . 

<root> The project brings together established research strengths in Spanish art history , experimental psychology , digital humanities , and museum studies to explore , using eye-tracking techniques , aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole . 

<root> Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes ; the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork . 

<root> When regarding an artwork , a viewer gathers information through a series fixations , interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades . 

<root> The direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene ( e.g. colour , texture , brightness etc ) . 

<root> Importantly , studying eye movements offers an insight that does not depend on the participants ’ beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork . 

<root> Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts ( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 ) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) . 

<root> Zurbarán ’s cycle of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over 250 years . 

<root> It is the only cycle to be preserved in purpose-built surroundings in the UK , and one of very few of its kind in the world . 

<root> It has a long history in scholarship ( Baron & Beresford 2014 ) , but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood . 

<root> In this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham , of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks ( there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks , the 13th Benjamin , is a copy by Arthur Pond ) are a key part of , to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art , how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways . 

<root> This pilot project primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit , namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour . 

<root> 1 Introduction 

<root> Tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress , both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers . 

<root> Past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity , including ethnic , racial , and gender diversity . 

<root> As an example , research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers . 

<root> Additionally , diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [ 4 ] , which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists . 

<root> Despite these positive effects , however , quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult , due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce . 

<root> Measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce , particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science , is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced . 

<root> For many scientific fields , however , there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty , making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis . 

<root> Further , rates of adoption of services like GoogleScholar and ResearchGate vary within , and across disciplines . 

<root> For instance , gender representation in computing is an important issue with broad implications [ 5 ] , but without a full census of computing faculty , the degree of inequality and its possible sources are difficult to establish [ 6 ] . 

<root> Some disciplines , like political science , are organized around a single professional society , whose membership roll approximates a full census [ 7 ] . 

<root> Most fields , on the other hand , including computer science , lack a single all-encompassing organization and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists , such as web-based faculty directories for individual departments . 

<root> Because assembling such a full census is difficult , past studies have tended to avoid this task and have instead used samples of researchers [ 8 – 11 ] , usually specific to a particular field [ 12 – 16 ] , and often focused on the scientific elite [ 17 , 18 ] . 

<root> Although useful , such samples are not representative of the scientific workforce as a whole and thus have limited generalizability . 

<root> One of the largest census efforts to date assembled , by hand , a nearly complete record of three academic fields : computer science , history , and business [ 19 ] . 

<root> This data set has shed considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training , placement , and scholarly productivity [ 6 , 19 , 20 ] . 

<root> But , this data set is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence offers few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields . 

<root> In some fields , yearly data on faculty numbers and composition are available in aggregate . 

<root> In computer science , the Computing Research Association ( CRA ) documents trends in the employment of PhD recipients through the annual Taulbee survey of computing departments in North America ( cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey ) . 

<root> Such surveys can provide valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses . 

<root> First , surveys are subject to variable response rates and the misinterpretation of questions or sample frames , which can inject bias into fine-grained analyses [ 21 , 22 ] . 

<root> Second , aggregate information provides only a high-level view of a field , which can make it difficult to investigate causality [ 23 ] . 

<root> For example , differences in recruitment and retention strategies across departments will be washed out by averaging , thereby masking any insights into the efficacy of individual strategies and policies . 

<root> Here , we present a novel system , based on a topical web crawler , that can quickly and automatically assemble a full census of an academic field using digital data available on the public World Wide Web . 

<root> This system is efficient and accurate , and it can be adapted to any academic discipline and used for continuous collection . 

<root> The system is capable of collecting census data for an entire academic field in just a few hours using off-the-shelf computing hardware , a vast improvement over the roughly 1600 hours required to do this task by hand [ 19 ] . 

<root> By assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone , this system will facilitate new research on the composition of academic fields by providing access to complete faculty listings , without having to rely on surveys or professional societies . 

<root> This system can also be used longitudinally to study how the workforce ’s composition changes over time , which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty . 

<root> Finally , applied to many academic fields in parallel , the system can elucidate scientists ’ movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances . 

<root> In short , many important research questions will benefit from the availability of accurate and frequently-recollected census data . 

<root> Our study is organized as follows . 

<root> We begin by detailing the design and implementation of our web crawler framework . 

<root> Next , we present the results of our work in two sections . 

<root> The first demonstrates the validity and utility of the crawler by collecting census data for the field of computer science and comparing it to a hand-curated census , collected in 2011 [ 19 ] . 

<root> The second provides an example of the type of research enabled by our system and uses the 2011 and 2017 censuses to investigate the “ leaky pipeline ” problem in faculty retention . 

<root> Epistemic pollution 

<root> Agents can rationally choose between experts only if the criteria that distinguish genuine experts from charlatans are common sense or widely known : 

<root> if agents are to satisfy the epistemic conditions on responsibility , they must know what kinds of knowledge they must utilize to guide their selection of sources ( on pain of infinite regress ) . 

<root> In fact , many , if not all , the markers of expertise identified by philosophers enjoy widespread recognition . 

<root> The fact that these criteria are widely known , however , offers an opportunity to those who would use them for deception , witting or unwitting . 

<root> Since expertise must be assessed through indirect markers , to mimic the markers of expertise is to mimic expertise [ 17 ] . 

<root> We live in an epistemic environment that is heavily and deliberately polluted by agents who use mimicry and other methods as a means of inflating their pretense to expertise . 

<root> This fact , together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur , reduces ordinary people ’s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources . 

<root> For instance , those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise , taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in . 

<root> There are some egregious examples of this practice in the field of health care . 

<root> For example , a small number of doctors set up the American College of Pediatricians ( ACPeds ) to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care . 

<root> Such an organization is surely permissible , but it has had the unfortunate ( and likely intended ) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large . 

<root> Thus , when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [ 21 ] , many people mistook the organization ’s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians — although the peak body for pediatric workers , the American Academy of Pediatrics , has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [ 22 ] . 

<root> Insofar as the larger organization , with a broader membership base , can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise , it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization . 

<root> When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession , it introduces an epistemic pollutant . 

<root> A yet more egregious example of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer-reviewed journals in the interest of promoting the companies ’ commercial products [ 23 ] . 

<root> The companies hoped to leverage the prestige of Elsevier with these fake journals to endow their promotional “ research ” with an air of reliability . 

<root> When the deceit was uncovered , however , the effect was just the opposite : 

<root> the legitimacy of the published findings was not enhanced through their publication by Elsevier , but rather the legitimacy of Elsevier ’s publications — and , by extension , all academic journals — was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research . 

<root> More recently , institutions of academic expertise have been subject to a large and growing outbreak of so-called predatory journals — journals that will publish almost anything for a fee . 

<root> Once again , this phenomenon has the effect of making peer-reviewed journals appear less legitimate . 

<root> At times , even those who work in academia may be unsure of a particular journal ’s legitimacy , and there are genuine borderline cases . 

<root> For example , the Frontiers contingent of journals appears legitimate — at least to me — despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee . 8 

<root> Yet some Frontiers journals appear to have engaged in bad behavior , whether for profit or for some other motive . 

<root> Frontiers in Public Health controversially published articles linking vaccines and autism [ 24 ] and questioning the link between HIV and AIDS [ 25 ] . 

<root> Whether due to this behavior or not , Jeffrey Beall decided to add the publisher to his influential ( but now sadly unavailable ) list of questionable journals [ 26 ] . 

<root> The controversy surrounding Beall ’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals . 

<root> If academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate , one can not reasonably expect ordinary people to make such judgments . 

<root> If their confidence in scientific findings is lowered across the board as the result of such epistemic pollution , one can hardly blame them . 

<root> Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise , it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions . 

<root> Epistemic pollution may stem not only from counterfeit institutions of knowledge production but also from bad behavior by legitimate institutions . 9 

<root> For example , pollution may result from attempts to game the systems put in place to track expertise . 

<root> Consider institutions with a credentialing function , such as universities , bar associations , or peer review bodies . 

<root> These institutions do not exist solely to credential experts . 

<root> They have other functions , and these functions may come into conflict , creating pressures to inflate credentials . 

<root> For example , universities have a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff , thereby increasing their rankings , bringing in grant money , and attracting students . 

<root> Systems that assess expertise can be manipulated , and many cases of such manipulation exist — take the recent example by the University of Malaysia , which attempted to boost metrics by urging its faculty to cite one another [ 28 ] . 

<root> For this reason , institutions may also be slow to investigate accusations of fraud , and they may try to keep their discoveries in-house to protect their reputations . 

<root> The Use of Cognitive Digital Games in School : 

<root> Contributions to Attention 

<root> Daniela Karine Ramos dadaniela@gmail.com Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin 

<root> Bruna Anastacio brunaanastacio@hotmail.com Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin 

<root> Cognitive games involve a number of different games working aspects of human cognition , while proposing the intersection between the sets of concepts , fun and cognition , for the improvement of cognitive functions . 

<root> The attention is the main point made in this study , since it is fundamental to the learning process and be recurring complaint among parents and teachers in schools . 

<root> With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes , researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills ( Li , Polat , Scalzo , & Bavelier , 2010 ) ; on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously ( Dye & Bavelier , 2010 ; Feng , Spence , & Pratt , 2007 ) ; and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time ( Boot , Kramer , Simons , Fabiani , & Gratton , 2008 ) . 

<root> Other studies specifically investigate the use of digital games in the school context and suggest potential for digital game use to improve of student 's attention span at preschool age ( Rueda , Checa , & Cómbita , 2012 ) , to improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary school children ( Miller & Robertson , 2010 ) , and to better performance of working memory ability ( Klingberg et al. , 2005 ; Thorell , Lindqvist , Nutley , Bohlin , & Klingberg , 2009 ) . 

<root> Considering the importance of the proper functioning of attention , because of its involvement in the regulation of thoughts and emotions , maintaining the performance of this process is very important , especially in school , where the child must acquire content in an environment full of countless distractors . 

<root> The study in question focuses on the attention , proposing and evaluation in the context of the classroom . 

<root> Thus , it suggests the use of digital games in an integrated way the school activities in the classroom . 

<root> The games have features like increasing challenges , rules that establish what can and can not be done , and involvement of the player in the quest to gain skills and win the game ( Kirriemuir & McFarlane , 2004 ; Prensky , 2005 ) . 

<root> We aim to investigate the contributions of the use of a system that integrates cognitive digital games to a database , of the Escola do Cérebro , for monitoring and improvement of cognitive skills , highlighting the attention . 

<root> The games involve challenges and rules involving the exercise of cognitive functions , especially the working memory , attention and capacity of solving problems . 

<root> The study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches . 

<root> It collects the data based on the observation of the proposed interventions as well as interviews conducted with participating teachers and students to identify their perceptions of digital games ’ contributions to the learning process . 

<root> Furthermore , before and after the implementation of the intervention , we performed a D2 Test of attention that measures selective and sustained attention , as well as visual scanning accuracy and speed . 

<root> The intervention consisted in the use of the Escola do Cérebro , using tablets in the classroom , daily for a period of five weeks . 

<root> The sample consisted of 71 students of the Application School of Basic Education , Federal University of Santa Catarina , aged 7 and 9 years old ( M = 7.64 ± 1.12 ) , which were divided into two groups : participant and control . 

<root> The first ( n = 31 ) participated in the intervention , the control group ( n = 40 ) was only evaluated using the test before and after the same time interval of interventions . 

<root> The Escola do Cérebro is a platform that integrates seven digital games into a database . 

<root> The application allows visualization of the player 's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers . 

<root> Students have their scores measured by four variables : time , speed , stability and accuracy . 

<root> A statistical analysis was performed based on the application of the paired t-test on the difference of the overall score obtained in the test before and after the intervention in the two groups . 

<root> The difference in the results obtained from the application of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) , 

<root> the participant group had mean and standard deviation 60.23 ( 64.75 ) respectively , while the control group was 20.00 ( 42.65 ) . 

<root> The result indicates significant improvement in the performance of the sustained attention in the test , as well as a high dispersion , which reveals a variation in relation to the performance . 

<root> In addition , students participating in the interview reported a preference for games that involve problem solving , recognize the need to plan actions in relation to their importance for the game and for daily activities , and realize improvements in the ability to sustain attention . 

<root> The teachers observed changes after the intervention , emphasizing the greater persistence and involvement in school activities , and in some students , improvement in the ability to sustain attention . 

<root> From this , we conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games offers contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention . 

<root> 4. Discussion . 

<root> We hypothesized that the children , who were over the age of six at the time of collection , would have adult-like SI interpretations . 

<root> We expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments , and would result in adult-like interpretations . 

<root> Further , we posited that if our initial hypothesis was not supported , and in fact there was some non-adult-like performance , that there would be significant variability among the conditions , with cardinal numbers having the highest performance and some the weakest . 

<root> On the surface , it does seem as if there is variability and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding ( see limitations below ) , but at least for this study , the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some . 

<root> Significant differences were not observed between all and cardinal numbers or all and some . 

<root> 4.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS . 

<root> This study is limited in its power and generalizability . 

<root> It serves as a reminder of the work that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally . 

<root> Bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people using them . 

<root> Future studies need to include more participants and more items to increase power . 

<root> Future studies should also include a larger age range of children to document the age at which adult-like performance emerges . 

<root> Related cross-cultural studies have resulted in insufficient statistical power , but interesting trends ( e.g. , Nedwick , 2014 ) . 

<root> Follow-up studies with increased stimuli and participants are needed . 

<root> In a future study , it is also important to consider if additional training in the difference between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments would impact results , or if more naturalistic experimental conditions ( e.g. , demonstrating actions using real objects instead of two-dimensional depictions ) would be beneficial . 

<root> Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior ( Hein , Reich , Marks , Thuma , & Grigorenko , 2016 ) . 

<root> The current study is too small to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods ; 

<root> however , in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type . 

<root> In the current study , the responses from two children were not included because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items . 

<root> More specifically , they answered “ yes ” that the puppet described the pictures well . 

<root> It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions , and in this regard , are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations . 

<root> This is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well . 

<root> It is also possible though that these two children were attempting to please the data collectors , or be polite , and that “ yes ” was in some ways a default answer to be provided when having to respond verbally in a test context . 

<root> Additional training with the methodology could improve outcomes . 

<root> The puppets used were picked specifically for this task with careful attention to their appearance . 

<root> Upon arrival at the school , however , it became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them . 

<root> Further exploration with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting . 

<root> Numbers through five in the participating communities are most often expressed with native Chitonga words while numbers greater than five are typically indicated using English borrowings . 

<root> The cardinal numbers included in this study were only one through five in order to avoid additional item variability , but larger numbers should be included in future research . 

<root> 5. Conclusion . 

<root> Albeit limited , these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research , but appears to be completed at a later age in this language . 

<root> This interesting combination of findings – expected hierarchy of difficulty , but differing age of acquisition – is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI and could be the result of language-specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences . 

<root> Utilization of busted CFL in developing cheap and efficient segmented compact LED bulbs 

<root> N S Andres and R T Ponce 

<root> Electrical Engineering Department , Bataan Peninsula State University , 2100 , Balanga City Bataan , Philippines 

<root> Abstract . 

<root> Today ’s generation will not survive a day without the help of lighting . 

<root> In fact , someone ’s productivity , particularly at night , depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity . 

<root> Lighting takes a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy particularly in the Philippines . 

<root> There are different type of lighting bulbs used at home can affect the overall lighting consumption . 

<root> Nowadays , most commonly and widely used bulb in the household is the Compact Fluorescent Light ( CFL ) . 

<root> However , the main problem of CFL is the mercury they contain . 

<root> In addition to this is the harmful effect of mercury such as Emission of UV Radiation . 

<root> In response to the said problem , this project study gives solution to the problem of the society concerning environment , health and safety as well energy conservation , by developing a segmented compact light-emitting diode ( SCLED ) bulb from busted CFL that are efficient , economical , and does not contain toxic chemicals . 

<root> 1. Introduction 

<root> Based on the results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey ( HECS ) , electricity remains as the most common source of energy used by households particularly in the Philippines . 

<root> About 87 percent of 21.0 million households used electricity from March to August 2011 . 

<root> As of 2016 , the demand for electricity in the residential is leading among the different sectors . 

<root> It is often grouped depending on its uses that are distributed for heating and cooling , lighting , operating appliances etc [ 1 ] 

<root> Figure 1 . 

<root> January - june 2016 philippine power demand 

<root> Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity , typical homes as shown in figure 1 , consume nearly 27 percent of the energy used today : making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption . 

<root> Lighting plays a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy ; it consumes about 18 % of the total generated electricity of total energy consumption in residential sectors as shown in figure 2 [ 2 ] . 

<root> Figure 2 . 

<root> Estimated electricity use in residential sector 

<root> One of the main factors in lighting energy consumption is the light bulb . 

<root> The use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage . 

<root> There are three general types of lighting that are widely used in the household nowadays : the ( light-emitting diode ) LED bulb , ( compact fluorescent light ) CFL bulb and the incandescent bulb . 

<root> But each of them has their perks and perils [ 3 ] . 

<root> Unfortunately , most of the time , people in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary . 

<root> Today , CFLs are the most used lighting sources in the household . 

<root> Using CFLs will allow people to decrease their energy consumption ; also it is a good start to decrease greenhouse emissions . 

<root> However , the main problem of CFLs is the mercury they contain . 

<root> When products and wastes containing mercury are improperly disposed of , mercury is released into the air , ground or water . 

<root> It is persistent in the environment ; it never breaks down nor goes away . 

<root> In addition to the harmful effects of mercury is that it emits Ultraviolet ( UV ) Radiation . 

<root> This UV radiation interacts with the chemicals on the inside of the bulb to generate light . 

<root> The acute and chronic effects are the normal responses of the skin to UVR ; acute reactions considered will be erythema ( sunburn ) and vitamin D production . 

<root> Skin aging and skin cancer will be discussed as those reactions produced by prolonged or repeated UVR exposure [ 4 ] . 

<root> In response to the aforementioned situation where the three types of lights are compared by their efficiency and effectiveness as light sources , the proponents conducted this study . 

<root> Since the CFLs are the most commonly used light bulbs in the residential and has a great compatibility to LED in terms of design and materials , the proponents conducted a study about innovating and recycling CFL into a more efficient and environment friendly LED light bulb . 

<root> Replication in Second Language Research : 

<root> Narrative and Systematic Reviews and Recommendations for the Field 

<root> Replication studies are considered by many to play a fundamental role in any scientific endeavor . 

<root> When using the same materials and procedures as a previous study , replication studies serve to test the reliability of the previous study ’s findings . 

<root> When altering specific methodological or participant characteristics of a previous study , they serve to test generalizability of the earlier findings under different conditions . 

<root> One indication of the importance of replication is found in the 50 or more calls for replication research in the field of second language ( L2 ) research alone ( see references for 50 calls and commentaries in Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information online ) : from Santos ( 1989 ) through Polio and Gass 1997 to very recent proposals for specific replication studies , such as Vandergrift and Cross 2017 and even a book-length treatment ( Porte , 2012 ) . 

<root> Beyond these calls , efforts to actively promote and facilitate replication studies have also emerged . 

<root> For example , the Instruments for Research into Second Languages ( IRIS ) repository ( http://www.irisdatabase.org ) was established in 2011 and holds , at the time of writing , over 3,800 materials that can be used for replication , among other purposes , in L2 research ( Marsden & Mackey , 2014 ; Marsden , Mackey , & Plonsky , 2016 ) . 

<root> The Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io ) , also established in 2011 , provides a web infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and has been used for large replication efforts in psychology ( e.g. , Open Science Collaboration , 2015 ) , which continue to make waves in academia ( Laws , 2016 ; Lindsay , 2015 ; Martin & Clarke , 2017 ) and the general media ( Baker , 2015 ; Devlin , 2016 ) . 

<root> In some fields , a flourishing metascience , that is , the scientific study of science ( see Munafò et al. , 2017 ) , has included syntheses assessing the quantity and nature of replication efforts , for example , in education ( Makel & Plucker , 2014 and in psychology ( Makel et al. , 2012 ) . 

<root> The driving force behind this battery of calls , commentaries , infrastructure , and metascience is a perceived crisis in the state of replication research . 

<root> The severe concerns underpinning the alleged crisis have several dimensions relating to : (a) the ( small ) amount of published replication research ; (b) the ( poor ) quality of replication research ; and (c) the ( lack of ) reproducibility , which refers to the extent to which findings can ( not ) be reproduced in replication attempts that have been undertaken . 

<root> These concerns speak to the very core of science , raising fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of our work . 

<root> Indeed , some commentators have called replication the “ gold standard ” of research evidence ( Jasny , Chin , Chong , & Vignieri , 2011 , p. 1225 ) and a “ linchpin of the scientific process ” ( Let ’s replicate , 2006 , p. 330 ) . 

<root> In the field of L2 research , given the importance of replication and the 50 calls for replication in L2 research that we identified , one might expect a substantial number of published replication studies by now . 

<root> However , a perceived lack of prestige , excitement , and originality of replication plagues L2 research ( Porte , 2012 ) , as it does other disciplines ( Berez-Kroeker et al. , 2017 ; Branco , Cohen , Vossen , Ide , & Calzolari , 2017 ; Chambers , 2017 ; Schmidt , 2009 ) , and these perceptions are thought to have caused , at least in part ( directly or indirectly ) , alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies . 

<root> However , a systematic metascience on replication research has not yet been established in the field of L2 research , leaving a poor understanding of the actual number and nature of replication studies that have been published . 

<root> The current study begins to address this gap through narrative and systematic reviews . 

<root> The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology , given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research , and also from education , another key sister discipline . 

<root> The narrative review is organized around four broad themes : (a) the quantity of replication research , (b) the nature of replication research , (c) the relationship between initial and replication studies , and (d) the interpretation and extent of reproducibility of the findings of initial studies . 

<root> To gain insight into these issues in the context of L2 research , the systematic review provides a synthesis of L2 studies in journal articles that self-labeled as replications . 

<root> The research questions and methods of the systematic review were largely determined by the narrative review but also emerged through the design and piloting of the coding instrument . 

<root> Finally , we offer further discussion and 16 recommendations for future replication work that draw on our narrative and systematic reviews and on our experience of carrying out multisite ( Morgan-Short et al. , 2018 ) 1 and single site ( Faretta-Stutenberg & Morgan-Short , 2011 ; Marsden , Williams , & Liu , 2013 ; McManus & Marsden , 2017 ; Morgan-Short , Heil , Botero-Moriaty , & Ebert , 2012 ) replications . 

<root> We start from the widely agreed premise that testing the reproducibility of findings should have an essential role in the testing and refinement of theory , at least for hypothesis-testing epistemologies that seek to ascertain generalizability and for other epistemologies in which constructs are deemed to be definable and observable . 

<root> Thus , our overall aim is to provide conceptual clarification and an empirical base for future discussion and production of replication studies , with a view to improving the amount and quality of L2 replication research .

<root> A Comparative Discourse Analysis of Fan Responses to Game of Thrones 

<root> It is no exaggeration to say that HBO ’s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand : 

<root> it is a transmedia system in the sense first used by Marsha Kinder ( 1991 ) and popularized by Henry Jenkins ( 2006 ) , in which media-hopping networks of intertextualities extend the “ storyworld ” of an original production . 

<root> Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes , with an average global viewership ( from its most recent season ) of 25.1 million viewers per episode ( Shepherd , 2016 ) , it has spawned five video games , a graphic novel adaptation , several companion books , two rap albums , a 28-city orchestral tour , a wide variety of tabletop games , toys , merchandise and mobile apps , and countless podcasts , fanfics and other fan-based creations . 

<root> Given the volume of content this represents , it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom . 

<root> As such , the Game of Thrones storyworld represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new , who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts in order to fully engage with its narratives . 

<root> In this sense , fans of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored . 

<root> Transmedia systems , like that exemplified by Game of Thrones , are becoming increasingly prevalent ( e.g. , Star Wars , Harry Potter , The Walking Dead , the Marvel Cinematic Universe , etc ) ; 

<root> these systems demonstrate , in microcosm , the global challenge of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society . 

<root> The study of how people , as fans , access and manage information within a transmedia system provides valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry , but to the wider context of cultural studies , by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information-user . 

<root> For us , as digital humanists , defining the “ transmedia fan ” is of particular relevance as we seek to understand contemporary social and cultural transformations engendered by digital technologies . 

<root> Methodology 

<root> As a first step in defining the “ transmedia fan ” , the current project undertakes a comparative discourse analysis of online conversations of Game of Thrones fans . 

<root> One of the most dramatic plot developments in the source material ( Martin , 2000 ) was adapted to the screen in the penultimate episode of the third season , “ The Rains of Castamere ” ( Benioff & Weiss , 2013 ) . 

<root> Readers of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the “ Red Wedding ” , while fans of the show unfamiliar with Martin ’s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode . 

<root> Since the television series ’ inception , writers at The AV Club have written two critical reviews for each episode : 

<root> one for viewers familiar with the books ( i.e. , “ Experts ” ) and one for viewers unfamiliar with the books and averse to “ spoilers ” ( i.e. , “ Newbies ” ) . 

<root> What results are two completely separate reviews of “ The Rains of Castamere ” which in turn document the fans ’ reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads : 

<root> one comment thread where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode and one comment thread where fans had hotly anticipated it . 

<root> As a pilot project , the current work takes the content of both comment threads — a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments — and analyzes each thread separately using a qualitative coding method aligned with constructivist grounded theory ( Charmaz , 2006 ) . 

<root> Through this analysis , a categorization of themes emerges illustrating tactics for negotiating intertexts and paratexts unique to each group of fans . 

<root> These themes fall under two broad categories : 

<root> negotiation ( i.e. , emotional responses ) and tactical negotiation ( i.e. , cognitive , or reasoned responses ) . 

<root> A comparison of categories and sub-categories between both groups provides preliminary findings to support an emergent model , or models , of the “ transmedia fan ” . 

<root> Conclusion 

<root> The present research represents a first step in exploring the impact of transmedia systems , as exemplified by Game of Thrones , through the study of fans . 

<root> The question posed by this research is , fundamentally , an examination of how the problem of “ access ” is framed in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer . 

<root> Future research should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans using the principles of De Certeau ’s ( 1984 ) everyday life practice , in order to extend its application to the broader context of modern-day consumers . 

<root> The current study will contribute to the development of further qualitative and quantitative research that will more clearly define the information behaviors of the transmedia fan . 

<root> This project is of relevance to researchers in media studies , fan studies , information studies and digital humanities . 

<root> Daniel Bernoulli 

<root> Daniel Bernoulli FRS ( German pronunciation : [ bɛʁˈnʊli ] ; 8 February 1700 – 17 March 1782 ) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family . 

<root> He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics , especially fluid mechanics , and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics . 

<root> His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli 's principle , a particular example of the conservation of energy , which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century : the carburetor and the airplane wing . 

<root> Daniel Bernoulli 

<root> Early life 

<root> Frontpage of Hydrodynamica ( 1738 ) 

<root> Daniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen , in the Netherlands , into a family of distinguished mathematicians . 

<root> The Bernoulli family came originally from Antwerp , at that time in the Spanish Netherlands , but emigrated to escape the Spanish persecution of the Huguenots . 

<root> After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel , in Switzerland . 

<root> Daniel was a son of Johann Bernoulli ( one of the " early developers " of calculus ) and a nephew of Jacob Bernoulli ( who " was the first to discover the theory of probability " ) . 

<root> He had two brothers , Niklaus and Johann II . 

<root> Daniel Bernoulli was described by W. W. Rouse Ball as " by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis " . 

<root> He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father . 

<root> Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris , Johann , unable to bear the " shame " of being compared Daniel 's equal , banned Daniel from his house . 

<root> Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel 's book Hydrodynamica in his own book Hydraulica which he backdated to before Hydrodynamica . 

<root> Despite Daniel 's attempts at reconciliation , his father carried the grudge until his death . 

<root> Around schooling age , his father , Johann , encouraged him to study business , there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician . 

<root> However , Daniel refused , because he wanted to study mathematics . 

<root> He later gave in to his father 's wish and studied business . 

<root> His father then asked him to study in medicine , and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately , which they continued for some time . 

<root> Daniel studied medicine at Basel , Heidelberg , and Strasbourg , and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721 . 

<root> He was a contemporary and close friend of Leonhard Euler . 

<root> He went to St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics , but was very unhappy there , and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersburg . 

<root> He returned to the University of Basel , where he successively held the chairs of medicine , metaphysics , and natural philosophy until his death . 

<root> In May , 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society . 

<root> Mathematical work 

<root> His earliest mathematical work was the Exercitationes ( Mathematical Exercises ) , published in 1724 with the help of Goldbach . 

<root> Two years later he pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation . 

<root> His chief work is Hydrodynamica , published in 1738 ; 

<root> it resembles Joseph Louis Lagrange 's Mécanique Analytique in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle , namely , conservation of energy . 

<root> This was followed by a memoir on the theory of the tides , to which , conjointly with the memoirs by Euler and Colin Maclaurin , a prize was awarded by the French Academy : these three memoirs contain all that was done on this subject between the publication of Isaac Newton 's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica and the investigations of Pierre-Simon Laplace . 

<root> Bernoulli also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions , especially on problems connected with vibrating strings , and the solutions given by Brook Taylor and by Jean le Rond d'Alembert . 

<root> Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids . 

<root> In particular , they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure . 

<root> To investigate this , Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid 's pressure in the pipe . 

<root> Soon physicians all over Europe were measuring patients ' blood pressure by sticking point-ended glass tubes directly into their arteries . 

<root> It was not until about 170 years later , in 1896 that an Italian doctor discovered a less painful method which is still in use today . 

<root> However , Bernoulli 's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft to measure the speed of the air passing the plane ; that is its air speed . 

<root> Taking his discoveries further , Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy . 

<root> It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height . 

<root> Daniel realised that in a similar way , a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure . 

<root> Mathematically this law is now written : ½ ρ u 2 + P = constant where P is pressure , ρ is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity . 

<root> A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls . 

<root> This is exploited by the wing of an aeroplane which is designed to create an area above its surface where the air velocity increases . 

<root> The pressure in this area is lower than that under the wing , so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing . 

<root> Pierre Charles L'Enfant , 

<root> Pierre Charles L'Enfant ( French : [ pjɛʁ ʃɑʁl lɑ̃fɑ̃ ] ; August 2 , 1754 – June 14 , 1825 ) , self-identified as Peter Charles L'Enfant while living in the United States , was a French-born American military engineer who designed the basic plan for Washington , D.C. ( capital city of the U.S. ) known today as the L'Enfant Plan ( 1791 ) . 

<root> Early life and education 

<root> L'Enfant was born in Paris , France on August 2 , 1754 , the third child and second son of Pierre L'Enfant ( 1704 – 1787 ) , a painter with a good reputation in the service of King Louis XV of France , ( 1710 - 1774 , reigned 1715 - 1774 ) , and Marie L'Enfant , the daughter of a minor official at court . 

<root> In 1758 , his brother Pierre Joseph died at the age of six , and Pierre Charles became the eldest son . 

<root> He studied art at the Royal Academy in the Louvre , as well as with his father at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture . 

<root> He left school in France to enlist in the American Revolutionary War on the side of the rebelling colonials . 

<root> Military service 

<root> L'Enfant was recruited by Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais to serve in the American Revolutionary War in the United States . 

<root> He arrived in 1777 at the age of 23 , and served as a military engineer in the Continental Army with Major General Lafayette . 

<root> He was commissioned as a captain in the Corps of Engineers on April 3 , 1779 to rank from February 18 , 1778 . 

<root> Despite his aristocratic origins , L'Enfant closely identified with the United States , changing his first name from Pierre to Peter when he first came to the rebelling colonies in 1777 . 

<root> L'Enfant served on General George Washington 's staff at Valley Forge . 

<root> While there , the Marquis de Lafayette commissioned L'Enfant to paint a portrait of Washington . 

<root> He was wounded at the Siege of Savannah on October 9 , 1779 . 

<root> He recovered and became a prisoner of war at surrender of Charleston , South Carolina on May 12 , 1780 . 

<root> He was exchanged in November 1780 and served on General George Washington 's staff for the remainder of the American Revolution . 

<root> L'Enfant was promoted by brevet to Major in the Corps of Engineers on May 2 , 1783 , in recognition of his service to the cause of American liberty . 

<root> He was discharged when the Continental Army was disbanded in December 1783 . 

<root> After the war , L'Enfant designed the badge of the Society of the Cincinnati , an organization of former officers of the Continental Army , shaped as an eagle , at the request of Washington . 

<root> He was sent to France to have insignias made for members of the Society , a group of veterans of the war . 

<root> Career 

<root> Post–Revolutionary War 

<root> Following the American Revolutionary War , L'Enfant established a successful and highly profitable civil engineering firm in New York City . 

<root> He achieved some fame as an architect by redesigning the City Hall in New York for the First Congress of the United States ( See : Federal Hall ) . 

<root> He also designed furniture and houses for the wealthy as well as coins and medals , including the insignia of the Society of the Cincinnati . 

<root> He was also a friend of Alexander Hamilton , and some of their correspondances from 1790 to 1801 now reside in the National Archives . 

<root> While L'Enfant was in New York City , he was initiated into Freemasonry . 

<root> His initiation took place on April 17 , 1789 , at Holland Lodge No. 8 , F&AM , which the Grand Lodge of New York F&AM had chartered in 1787 . 

<root> L'Enfant took only the first of three degrees offered by the Lodge and did not progress further in Freemasonry . 

<root> Final days 

<root> Siméon Poisson reviewed Galois ' paper on equation theory and declared it " incomprehensible " . 

<root> Galois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale , although he continued to spend time in political activities . 

<root> After his expulsion became official in January 1831 , he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest , but this waned , as it seemed that his political activism had priority . [ 4 ] [ 7 ] 

<root> Siméon Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations , which he did on 17 January 1831 . 

<root> Around 4 July 1831 , Poisson declared Galois ' work " incomprehensible " , declaring that " [ Galois ' ] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor " ; however , the rejection report ends on an encouraging note : " We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion . " [ 16 ] 

<root> While Poisson 's report was made before Galois ' July 14 arrest , it took until October to reach Galois in prison . 

<root> It is unsurprising , in the light of his character and situation at the time , that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter , and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier . 

<root> Apparently , however , Galois did not ignore Poisson 's advice , as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison , and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832 , [ 12 ] after which he was somehow talked into a duel . [ 8 ] 

<root> Galois ' fatal duel took place on 30 May . [ 17 ] 

<root> The true motives behind the duel are obscure . 

<root> There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it . 

<root> What is known is that five days before his death , he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair . [ 7 ] 

<root> Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle Stéphanie-Félicie Poterin du Motel , [ 18 ] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life . 

<root> Fragments of letters from her , copied by Galois himself ( with many portions , such as her name , either obliterated or deliberately omitted ) , are available . [ 19 ] 

<root> The letters hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois , and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf . 

<root> This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died . 

<root> Galois ' cousin , Gabriel Demante , when asked if he knew the cause of the duel , mentioned that Galois " found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé , each of whom provoked the duel . " 

<root> Galois himself famously exclaimed : " I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes . " [ 12 ] 

<root> Much more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois ' biographers ( most notably by Eric Temple Bell in Men of Mathematics ) , such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy . [ 14 ] 

<root> As to his opponent in the duel , Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville , [ 13 ] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois ' first arrest . [ 20 ] 

<root> However , Dumas is alone in this assertion , and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved . 

<root> It has been speculated that he might have been du Motel 's " supposed fiancé " at the time ( she ultimately married someone else ) , but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture . 

<root> On the other hand , extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent ( identified by the initials " L. D. " ) that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois ' Republican friends , most probably Ernest Duchatelet , who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges . [ 21 ] 

<root> Given the conflicting information available , the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history . 

<root> Whatever the reasons behind the duel , Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament , the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas , and three attached manuscripts . [ 22 ] 

<root> Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament , " This letter , if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains , is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind . " 

<root> However , the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated . [ 7 ] 

<root> In these final papers , he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers . 

<root> The Galois memorial in the cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine . 

<root> Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave and the exact location is still unknown . 

<root> Early in the morning of 30 May 1832 , he was shot in the abdomen , [ 17 ] abandoned by his opponents and seconds , and was found by a passing farmer . 

<root> He died the following morning [ 17 ] at ten o'clock in the Hôpital Cochin ( probably of peritonitis ) , after refusing the offices of a priest . 

<root> His funeral ended in riots . [ 17 ] 

<root> There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral , but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque 's death , and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June . 

<root> Only Galois ' younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois ' death . [ 23 ] 

<root> He was 20 years old . 

<root> His last words to his younger brother Alfred were : 

<root> “ Ne pleure pas , Alfred ! 

<root> J' ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir à vingt ans ! ” 

<root> ( Do n't cry , Alfred ! 

<root> I need all my courage to die at twenty ! ) 

<root> On 2 June , Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse Cemetery whose exact location is unknown . [ 17 ] [ 15 ] 

<root> In the cemetery of his native town – Bourg-la-Reine – a cenotaph in his honour was erected beside the graves of his relatives . [ 24 ] 

<root> A bust of Patrick Gordon in Yekaterinburg , Russia 

<root> Patrick Leopold Gordon of Auchleuchries ( 31 March 1635 in Auchleuchries , Aberdeenshire , Scotland – 29 November 1699 in Moscow , Russia ) was a general and rear admiral in Russia , of Scottish origin . 

<root> He was descended from a family of Aberdeenshire , holders of the small estate of Auchleuchries , near Ellon . 

<root> The family was connected with the noble branch of Haddo . 

<root> As a result of his distinguished service for Sweden , Poland and Russia he rose in ranks from trooper to full general , and became principal advisor and close friend of Tsar Peter the Great . 

<root> Gordon assumed the additional Christian name of Leopold when confirmed as a Roman Catholic shortly before his death . 

<root> Life 

<root> Gordon was brought up and remained a lifelong Roman Catholic , at a time when the Church was being persecuted in Scotland , which had become Calvinist . 

<root> After an education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon , at age of fifteen he entered the Jesuit college at Braunsberg , East Prussia , then part of Poland ; however , his character did not tolerate well the strict and sombre way of life at the school , and he soon decided to return home . 

<root> He changed his mind , however , before re-embarking on the journey back to Scotland , and after journeying on foot in several parts of what is today Germany , in 1655 he enlisted at Hamburg into the military service of Sweden . 

<root> In the course of the next five years he served alternately for Poland and Sweden and was taken prisoner by both . 

<root> At the Battle of Chudnov in 1660 , Gordon was wounded . [ 1 ] 

<root> Upon hearing of the Stuart restoration , Gordon left the Polish service , but found himself unable to obtain military employment in Scotland or England . [ 1 ] 

<root> In 1661 , after further experiences as a soldier of fortune , he joined the Russian army under Tsar Aleksei I , and in 1665 was sent on a special mission to England . 

<root> After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the Turks and Tatars in southern Russia . 

<root> Gordon disliked the Russian service , complaining of the corruption and venality of Russian officials , which left him , in his own words , " almost at wit s end with vexation " . [ 2 ] 

<root> However , in recognition of his service he was promoted to major-general in 1678 , was appointed to the high command at Kiev in 1679 , and in 1683 was made lieutenant-general . 

<root> He was not the only Scottish soldier in the Tsar 's service ; his fellow-Scots Paul Menzies and Alexander Livingston also found themselves in Russia fleeing religious intolerance or seeking adventure . 

<root> Gordon visited England and Scotland in 1686 . 

<root> In 1687 and 1689 he took part in expeditions against the Tatars in the Crimea , being made a full general . 

<root> Later in 1689 a revolution broke out in Moscow , and with the troops under his command Gordon virtually decided events in favour of Peter the Great , [ 3 ] and against the Regent , Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna . 

<root> Consequently , he was for the remainder of his life in high favour with the Tsar , who confided to him the command of his capital during his absence from Russia . 

<root> In 1696 , Gordon 's design of a " moveable rampart " played a key role in helping the Russians take Azov . [ 3 ] 

<root> Gordon 's alleged tomb at Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow . 

<root> One of Gordon 's greatest achievements was securing permission from the Tsars to establish the first Roman Catholic church and school in Muscovy , of which he remained the main benefactor , and headed the Catholic community in Russia until his death . 

<root> For his services his second son James , brigadier of the Russian army , was created Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1701 . 

<root> The Tsar employed him in organizing his army according to the West European system ; and raised him to the rank of full general . 

<root> At the end of his life the Tsar , who had visited Gordon frequently during his illness , was with him when he died , and with his own hands closed his eyes . 

<root> Originally buried in the Foreign Quarter , his remains were reinterred at Azov in 1877 , with an inscription in German which mistakenly gives his rank as Oberst , Colonel . 

<root> General Gordon left behind him a uniquely detailed diary of his life and times , written in English . 

<root> This is preserved in manuscript in the Russian State Military Archive in Moscow . 

<root> An incomplete and faulty German translation , edited by Dr Moritz Posselt ( Tagebuch des Generals Patrick Gordon ) was published , the first volume at Moscow in 1849 , the second at St Petersburg in 1851 , and the third at St Petersburg in 1853 ; and Passages from the Diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries ( 1635 – 1699 ) , was printed , under the editorship of Joseph Robertson , for the Spalding Club , at Aberdeen , Scotland , 1859 . 

<root> A new full scholarly edition of Gordon 's Diary in English was published by the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies in Aberdeen ( 6 vols , 2009 - 2016 ) , as well as its translation into Russian . 

<root> His daughter was married firstly to the German-Russian Colonel Rudolf Strasburgh , and then from 1699 or 1700 to his kinsman in the Russian service Alexander Gordon of Auchintoul , author of " The History of Peter the Great , Emperor of Russia " . 

<root> She lived until 1739 . [ 4 ] 

<root> Zaha Hadid 

<root> Dame Zaha Mohammad Hadid DBE RA ( Arabic : زها حديد Zahā Ḥadīd ; 31 October 1950 – 31 March 2016 ) was an Iraqi-British architect . 

<root> She was the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize , in 2004 . 

<root> She received the UK 's most prestigious architectural award , the Stirling Prize , in 2010 and 2011 . 

<root> In 2012 , she was made a Dame by Elizabeth II for services to architecture , and in 2015 she became the first and only woman to be awarded the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects . 

<root> She was described by The Guardian of London as the ' Queen of the curve ' , who " liberated architectural geometry , giving it a whole new expressive identity . " 

<root> Her major works include the aquatic centre for the London 2012 Olympics , Michigan State University 's Broad Art Museum in the US , and the Guangzhou Opera House in China . 

<root> Some of her designs have been presented posthumously , including the statuette for the 2017 Brit Awards , and many of her buildings are still under construction , including the Al Wakrah Stadium in Qatar , a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup . 

<root> Early life and academic career 

<root> Hadid was born on 31 October 1950 in Baghdad , Iraq , to an upper-class Iraqi family . 

<root> Her father Mohammed Hadid Muhammad al-Hajj Husayn Hadid was a wealthy industrialist from Mosul . 

<root> He co-founded the left-liberal al-Ahali group in 1932 , a significant political organisation in the 1930s and 1940s . 

<root> He was the co-founder of the National Democratic Party in Iraq . 

<root> He served as minister of finance after the overthrow of the monarch after the 1958 Iraqi coup d'état for the government of General Abd al-Karim Qasim . 

<root> Her mother Wajiha al-Sabunji was an artist from Mosul . 

<root> In the 1960s Hadid attended boarding schools in England and Switzerland . 

<root> Hadid studied mathematics at the American University of Beirut before moving , in 1972 , to London to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture . 

<root> There she studied with Rem Koolhaas , Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi . 

<root> Her former professor , Koolhaas , described her at graduation as " a planet in her own orbit . " 

<root> Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught . 

<root> " We called her the inventor of the 89 degrees . 

<root> Nothing was ever at 90 degrees . 

<root> She had spectacular vision . 

<root> All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces . " 

<root> He recalled that she was less interested in details , such as staircases . 

<root> " The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling , and the space was reducing and reducing , and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling . 

<root> She could n’t care about tiny details . 

<root> Her mind was on the broader pictures — 

<root> when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later . 

<root> She was right . ’ 

<root> Her fourth-year student project was a painting of a hotel in the form of a bridge , inspired by the works of the Russian suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich 

<root> Ichiyō Higuchi 

<root> Ichiyō Higuchi ( 樋口 一葉 Higuchi Ichiyō , May 2 , 1872 – November 23 , 1896 ) was a pen name of Japanese author Natsu Higuchi ( 樋口 奈津 Higuchi Natsu ) , also known as Natsuko Higuchi ( 樋口 夏子 Higuchi Natsuko ) . 

<root> Specializing in short stories , she was one of the first important writers to appear in the Meiji period ( 1868 - 1912 ) and Japan 's first prominent woman writer of modern times . 

<root> She wrote relatively little as a result of living a brief life — she died at 24 — but her stories had a large impact on Japanese literature and she is still appreciated by the Japanese public today . 

<root> Efforts to become a writer 

<root> She , her mother , and younger sister made ends meet by doing needlework , washing , and other jobs . 

<root> In 1892 , after seeing the success of a classmate , Kaho Tanabe , who wrote a novel , Higuchi decided to become a novelist to support her family . 

<root> Nevertheless , her initial efforts at writing fiction were in the form of a short story , a form to which she would remain true . 

<root> In 1891 she met her future advisor who would help , she assumed , this poet-turned-fiction-writer and connect her with editors : Tosui Nakarai . 

<root> She fell in love with him right away , not knowing that , at 31 , he had a reputation as a womanizer . 

<root> Nor did she realize that he wrote popular literature which aimed to please the general public and in no way wished to be associated with serious literature . 

<root> Her mentor did not return her passionate , if discreet , love for him , and instead treated her as a younger sister . 

<root> This failed relationship would become a recurrent theme in Higuchi 's fiction . 

<root> Eventually , she got the break she was so eager for : 

<root> her first stories were published in a minor newspaper under her pen name , Ichiyo Higuchi . 

<root> The stories from this first period ( 1892 – 94 ) suffered from the excessive influence of Heian poetry . 

<root> Higuchi felt compelled to demonstrate her classical literary training . 

<root> The plots were thin , there was little development of character and they were loaded down by excessive sentiment , especially when compared to what she was writing concurrently in her diary . 

<root> But she was developing rapidly . 

<root> Several of her trademark themes appear ; for example , the triangular relationship among a lonely , beautiful , young woman who has lost her parents , a handsome man who has abandoned her ( and remains in the background ) , and a lonely and desperate ragamuffin who falls in love with her . 

<root> Another theme Higuchi repeated was the ambition and cruelty of the Meiji middle class . 

<root> The story " Umoregi " ( " In Obscurity " ) signaled Higuchi 's arrival as a professional writer . 

<root> It was published in the prestigious journal Miyako no Hana in 1892 , only nine months after she had started writing in earnest . 

<root> Her work was noticed and she was recognized as a promising new author . 

<root> Her last years 

<root> In 1893 , Higuchi , her mother and her sister abandoned their middle class house and , with a grim determination to survive , moved to a poor neighborhood where they opened a stationery store that before long failed . 

<root> Their new dwelling was a five-minute walk from Tokyo 's ill-famed red-light district , the Yoshiwara . 

<root> Her experience living in this neighborhood would provide material for several of her later stories , especially " Takekurabe " , ( literally , " Comparing heights " ; " Child 's Play " in the Robert Lyons Danly translation ; also called " Growing Up " in the Edward Seidensticker translation . ) 

<root> The stories of her mature period ( 1894 – 96 ) were not only marked by her experience living near the red-light district and greater concern over the plight of women , but also by the influence of Ihara Saikaku , a 17th-century writer , whose stories she had recently discovered . 

<root> His distinctiveness lay in great part in his acceptance of low-life characters as worthwhile literary subjects . 

<root> What Higuchi added was a special awareness of suffering and sensitivity . 

<root> To this period belong " Ōtsugomori " ( " On the Last Day of the Year " ) , " Nigorie " ( " Troubled Waters " ) , " Wakare-Michi " ( " Separate Ways " ) , " Jūsan'ya " ( " The Thirteenth Night " ) and " Takekurabe " ( " Child 's Play " ) . 

<root> The last two are considered her best work . 

<root> With these last stories her fame spread throughout the Tokyo literary establishment . 

<root> In her humble home she was visited by other writers , students of poetry , admirers , the curious , critics , and editors requesting her collaboration . 

<root> But between constant interruptions and frequent headaches , Higuchi stopped writing . 

<root> As her father and one of her brothers had before her , she had caught tuberculosis . 

<root> She died on November 23 , 1896 , at the age of twenty-four . 

<root> Higuchi 's likeness adorns the Japanese 5000 yen banknote as of fall 2004 , becoming the third woman to appear on a Japanese banknote , after Empress Jingū in 1881 and Murasaki Shikibu in 2000 . 

<root> Her best-known stories have been made into movies .

<root> Eugene Nida 

<root> Eugene A. Nida ( November 11 , 1914 – August 25 , 2011 ) was a linguist who developed the dynamic-equivalence Bible-translation theory and one of the founders of the modern discipline of Translation Studies . 

<root> Life 

<root> Nida was born in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma on November 11 , 1914 . 

<root> He became a Christian at a young age , when he responded to the altar call at his church " to accept Christ as my Saviour . " 

<root> He graduated summa cum laude from the University of California in 1936 . 

<root> After graduating he attended Camp Wycliffe , where Bible translation theory was taught . 

<root> He ministered for a short time among the Tarahumara Indians in Chihuahua , Mexico , until health problems due to an inadequate diet and the high altitude forced him to leave . 

<root> Sometime in this period , Nida became a founding charter member of Wycliffe Bible Translators , a related organization to the Summer Institute of Linguistics . 

<root> In 1937 , Nida undertook studies at the University of Southern California , where he obtained a master 's degree in New Testament Greek in 1939 . 

<root> In that same year he became interim pastor of Calvary Church of Santa Ana , California following the resignation of its founding pastor . 

<root> Despite his conservative background , in later years Nida became increasingly ecumenical and New Evangelical ( clarification needed ) in his approach . 

<root> In 1943 , Nida received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan . 

<root> He was ordained as a Baptist minister . 

<root> He married Althea Lucille Sprague , who died in 1993 . 

<root> In 1997 , he married María Elena Fernandez-Miranda , a lawyer and diplomatic attache . 

<root> Nida retired in the early 1980s , although he continued to give lectures in universities all around the world , and lived in Alpine , Arizona , USA ; Madrid , Spain and Brussels , Belgium . 

<root> He died in Madrid on August 25 , 2011 aged 96 . 

<root> Theories 

<root> Nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics . 

<root> His Ph.D. dissertation , A Synopsis of English Syntax , was the first full-scale analysis of a major language according to the " immediate-constituent " theory . 

<root> His textbook Morphology : The Descriptive Analysis of Words was one of the major works of American Structuralism . 

<root> It remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises . 

<root> His most notable contribution to translation theory is Dynamic Equivalence , also known as Functional Equivalence . 

<root> For more information , see " Dynamic and formal equivalence . " 

<root> Nida also developed the componential analysis technique , which split words into their components to help determine equivalence in translation ( e.g. " bachelor " = male + unmarried ) . 

<root> This is , perhaps , not the best example of the technique , though it is the most well-known . 

<root> Nida 's dynamic-equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text ( ST ) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page , and that meaning is self-contained within the text ( i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence ) . 

<root> This theory , along with other theories of correspondence in translating , are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence , where Nida begins by asserting that given that " no two languages are identical , either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences , it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages . 

<root> Hence , there can be no fully exact translations . " 

<root> While the impact of a translation may be close to the original , there can be no identity in detail . 

<root> Nida then sets forth the differences in translation , as he would account for it , within three basic factors : 

<root> The nature of the message : 

<root> in some messages the content is of primary consideration , and in others the form must be given a higher priority . 

<root> The purpose of the author and of the translator : 

<root> to give information on both form and content ; 

<root> to aim at full intelligibility of the reader so he / she may understand the full implications of the message ; 

<root> for imperative purposes that aim at not just understanding the translation but also at ensuring no misunderstanding of the translation . 

<root> The type of audience : 

<root> prospective audiences differ both in decoding ability and in potential interest . 

<root> Nida brings in the reminder that while there are no such things as " identical equivalents " in translating , what one must in translating seek to do is find the " closest natural equivalent " . 

<root> Here he identifies two basic orientations in translating based on two different types of equivalence : 

<root> Formal Equivalence ( F-E ) and Dynamic Equivalence ( D-E ) . 

<root> F-E focuses attention on the message itself , in both form and content . 

<root> Such translations then would be concerned with such correspondences as poetry to poetry , sentence to sentence , and concept to concept . 

<root> Such a formal orientation that typifies this type of structural equivalence is called a " gloss translation " in which the translator aims at reproducing as literally and meaningfully as possible the form and content of the original . 

<root> The principles governing an F-E translation would then be : reproduction of grammatical units ; consistency in word usage ; and meanings in terms of the source context . 

<root> Theodorus of Tabennese 

<root> Theodorus of Tabennese ( c. 314 – 368 ) , also known as Abba Theodorus and Theodore the Sanctified was the spiritual successor to Pachomius and played a crucial role in preventing the first Christian cenobitic monastic federation from collapsing after the death of its founder . 

<root> Icon of St. Theodorus of Tabennese 

<root> Biography 

<root> According to hagiography , Theodorus was born into a wealthy Christian family and was well educated from a young age . 

<root> Early in life he denied the excesses of his parents , and at the age of fourteen joined a monastery in the diocese of Sne , near the modern town of Esna , Egypt . 

<root> A brother from Theodorus ’ monastery stayed with Pachomius in Tabennese while traveling and preached of the virtues of the Koinonia upon his return to Sne . 

<root> Praying and weeping , Theodorus became determined that his destiny lay with Pachomius . 

<root> Although initially denied passage to Tabennese by a Pachomian monk due to his wealthy background , Theodorus opted to follow the visiting monk , and his persistence ( and lack of obedience ) paid off . 

<root> He was welcomed by Pachomius upon his arrival , and quickly integrated into the community at Tabennese around 328 . 

<root> Quickly becoming a favorite of Pachomius , Theodorus lived an enviably ascetic life in the monastery , and took on the title of the " brothers ’ comforter " . 

<root> Theodorus asserted his influence openly ( which resulted in reprimands from Pachomius ) and generally maintained himself as a prominent figure at Tabennese for several years , despite never being given a position of power in the monastic hierarchy . 

<root> Finally , Pachomius called on him to preach to the brothers despite his youth , and eventually appointed him steward of Tabennese after several new monasteries had been built . 

<root> Retiring to the monastery of Phbow , Pachomius gave Theodorus complete control over Tabennese , though recalled him from the position after witnessing several monks under Theodorus ’ watch violating the monastic rules without reprimand . 

<root> Having failed to prove his governing ability and once more in a position no higher than when he had entered the monastery , Theodorus became a personal assistant to Pachomius and remained relatively quiet for some years . 

<root> Despite his clear potential and popularity , Pachomius refused to grant Theodorus any kind of authority ; though the old man 's failing health soon changed things forever . 

<root> After Theodorus had been assisting Pachomius at Tabennese for several years following his demotion , Pachomius became very ill and seemed to be on the verge of death . 

<root> Pachomius had not named a successor , and several brothers pleaded with Theodorus to assert himself as head of the Koinonia when the sickly man died . 

<root> Despite the assertion that Theodorus apparently did not want the rank of a father or this world 's glory , he consented . 

<root> Unfortunately for the would-be leader , Pachomius recovered , and upon hearing of Theodorus ’ decision , exiled the ambitious young man . 

<root> After living a life of constant weeping and prayer in solitude , Pachomius forgave Theodorus and allowed him to live among the brothers once more . 

<root> Normalcy returned , though never again would Pachomius fully trust his former protégé . 

<root> In 348 Pachomius died , naming the brother Petronios as his successor rather than the clearly qualified Theodorus . 

<root> The death of Petronios later that year would leave Apa Horsiesios in charge , and the popular Theodorus would retreat to the distant monastery of Phnoum . 

<root> Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia , problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader . 

<root> Refusing to work or communicate and demanding a new leader , many of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios . 

<root> The federation of monasteries was falling apart , and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese to placate the rebels . 

<root> Soon after his arrival , Theodorus was the new de facto leader , though he claimed to be only acting on behalf of Horsiesios . 

<root> For eighteen years Theodorus administered from Pachomius ’ old headquarters in Phbow , using techniques far more assertive than his predecessors , such as constantly shuffling the offices and locations of the most ambitious monks . 

<root> Yet in spite of this somewhat unstable shifting , the Koinonia was ruled peacefully for nearly two decades , at which point Theodorus predicted he would soon die . 

<root> Within a few months his prediction came true , and Apa Horsiesios once more took his place as the head of the communities in both title and authority . [ 1 ] 

<root> Everyone ’s just watching the weird retarded girl except this one chubby guy who ’s trying to get her to put down the lights but who ’s afraid to touch her . 

<root> “ Not supposed to touch those , ” he says . 

<root> “ Where ’s your mom ? 

<root> Is your mom here ? ” 

<root> “ Sorry ! ” I say . 

<root> The chubby guy frowns at me . 

<root> “ Cara , ” I say . 

<root> “ No hands . ” 

<root> Cara looks at me , looks at the lights . 

<root> I gently try to take them . 

<root> “ No ! ” she wails . 

<root> “ Pretty ! ” 

<root> “ I ’m sorry , ” I say , “ I ’m her brother . 

<root> She ’s developmentally delayed . 

<root> Cara ! 

<root> Cara , no . 

<root> No hands . ” 

<root> She wails , but lets me disentangle her hands . 

<root> “ I ’m sorry , ” I say again , the concerned big brother . 

<root> “ I was just looking around and thought she was right with me , you know ? 

<root> Our mom ’s down at Dillard ’s . ” 

<root> Chubby guy kind of hovers until I get the lights away from Cara and as soon as I put them on the shelf he grabs them and starts straightening them out and draping them back over the display . 

<root> I herd Cara towards the front of the store , mouthing sorry at the front cashier . 

<root> She ’s kind of pretty . 

<root> She smiles at me . 

<root> Nice big brother with retarded sister . 

<root> Back out in the mall , Cara is wailing , which could start an asthma attack , so to distract her I say , “ You want a cookie ? ” 

<root> Mom has Cara on a diet , so of course she wants a cookie . 

<root> She perks up the way Shelby , our Shetland Sheepdog does , when you say ‘ treat . ’ 

<root> I take her to the food court and buy her an M&M cookie and buy myself a Mountain Dew and then while she ’s eating her cookie , I pull the deck of cards out of my pocket and unwrap it . 

<root> We ’ve got another fifteen minutes before we have to meet my mom . 

<root> The idea is to play fish except every time you get a match you ’re supposed to do what it says . 

<root> Tie partner ’s hands with a silk scarf . 

<root> Kiss anywhere you like and see how long your partner can keep from moving or making any noise . 

<root> The one who lasts the longest gets to draw an extra card . 

<root> Tame , but pretty cool . 

<root> I ca n’t wait to show Toph and Len . 

<root> Cara has chocolate smeared on her mouth , but she lets me wipe her face off . 

<root> “ You ready to go back to see Mom ? ” I say . 

<root> When we pass Spencer ’s again , she stops . 

<root> “ Uhhh , ” she says , pointing to the store . 

<root> Mom always tries to get her to say what she wants , but I know what she wants and I do n’t want to fight with her . 

<root> “ No , ” I say . 

<root> “ Let ’s go see Mom . ” 

<root> Cara ’s face crumples up and she hunches her thick shoulders . 

<root> “ Uhhh , ” she says , mad . 

<root> “ It ’s okay , ” I say . 

<root> “ Come on . ” 

<root> She swings at me . 

<root> I grab her hand and pull her behind me . 

<root> She tries to sit down , but I just keep on tugging and she follows me , gulping and wailing . 

<root> “ What did you do ? ” my mom says when she sees us . 

<root> My mom had to buy stuff , like gym shorts for me and underwear for herself , so I told her that I ’d take Cara with me while she bought her stuff . 

<root> She ’s holding a Dillard ’s bag . 

<root> “ She wanted to go in Spencer ’s , ” I say . 

<root> “ We went in but she kept grabbing stuff and I had to take her out and now she ’s upset . ” 

<root> “ Robert , ” my mom says , irritated . 

<root> She crouches down . 

<root> “ Ah , Cara mia , do n’t cry . ” 

<root> We trail out of the store , Cara holding Mom ’s hand and sniffling . 

<root> By the time we get to the car , though , Cara ’s wheezing . 

<root> Mom digs out Cara ’s inhaler and Cara dutifully takes a hit . 

<root> I tried it once and it was pretty dreadful . 

<root> It felt really weird , trying to get that stuff in my lungs , and it made me feel a little buzzy but it did n’t even feel good , so it ’s pretty amazing that Cara will do it . 

<root> Cara sits in her booster seat in the back of the car , wheezing all the way home , getting worse and worse , and by the time we pull in the driveway , she ’s got that white look around her mouth . 

<root> “ Robert , ” Mom says , 

<root> “ I ’m going to have to take her to the Emergency Room . ” 

<root> “ Okay , ” I say and get out of the car . 

<root> “ You want to call your dad ? ” Mom asks . 

<root> “ I do n’t know how long we ’ll be . ” 

<root> Mom checks her watch . 

<root> It ’s three something now . 

<root> “ We may not be home in time for dinner . ” 

<root> I do n’t want to call my dad who is probably with Joyce , his girlfriend , anyway . 

<root> Joyce is always trying to be likable and it gets on my nerves after awhile — she tries way too hard . 

<root> “ I can just make a sandwich , ” I say . 

<root> “ I want you to stay at home , then , ” she says . 

<root> “ I ’ve got my cell phone if you need to call . ” 

<root> “ Can Toph and Len come over ? ” I ask . 

<root> She sighs . 

<root> “ Okay . 

<root> But no roughhousing . 

<root> Remember you have school tomorrow . ” 

<root> She opens the garage door so I can get in . 

<root> I stand there and watch her back down the driveway . 

<root> She turns back , watching where she ’s going , and she needs to get her hair done again because I can really see the gray roots . 

<root> Cara is watching me through the watery glass , her mouth a little open . 

<root> I wave good-bye . 

<root> I ’m glad they ’re gone . 

<root> The day it rained in the garden 

<root> The first drops of rain fell onto the parched stones from a cloudless blue sky . 

<root> They disappeared immediately , drunk down into the mineral silence . 

<root> The garden paused , and everything held its breath and waited . 

<root> More rain would come . 

<root> Everyone knew , beyond belief or necessity that the time had come . 

<root> And with it , the rain . 

<root> Heavy oily drops bounced from leaf to grass to dusty ground , gathering in stems and folds on the way . 

<root> Yet still the sky was a hard polished blue with not a cloud in sight . 

<root> Still the garden held its breath . 

<root> It would not be long now . 

<root> A spattering of drops plucked memories from deep in the roots , shivering through shoots and tendrils , humus and stone . 

<root> Wispy vapour trails marbled the blue surface above . 

<root> And then it rained for good . 

<root> We sat on the porch watching , no longer daring to dart out and leap around in the downfall as drops turned to torrents and the staccato tapping on the roof climaxed to a thunderous roar . 

<root> Pools erupted and overflowed along the edges of the lawn , cascading around the raspberry canes and over the flower beds . 

<root> Earthworms rose up from the water-laden earth where they could no longer breath and wriggled and struggled fro air on the surface , writhing and swimming for a safe haven . 

<root> Water burst over the barrels and cans standing under the eaves and gutters , flooding the pathways , carrying away all that was n’t fixed solid and licking at the stairs to the back porch before climbing each step and lapping against the planks we were sitting on , a wooden raft surrounded by angry water and martial beat drum , drum , drumming on the roof above . 

<root> We slipped out feet over the sides and when we felt the fish , some as big as logs , some as small as leaves , nibble at our feet , we leant over to watch them fraying and frolicking under the choppy surface . 

<root> Waves lapped at the porch , washing away the boxes , and bowls , and the dog ’s basket . 

<root> The rocking chair , the watering can , boxes of cuttings , and tied-up newspapers , all floated away as we slammed the kitchen door shut and retreated to the front room we gazed out at the river that the street had become . 

<root> The sky was pewter smeared with charcoal now , and pressed down hard on the rooftops , slowly dissolving everything below . 

<root> When the water rippled into the hallway , we splashed our way to the staircase and then up as it nipped at our heels . 

<root> Outside the other houses were rocks surrounded by sea with mermaids swimming all around , flapping their scaly tails and hauling themselves up , to fall backwards into the crest of the oncoming waves . 

<root> And as they swam they sang , their voices born on the winds and the salt and the rain , and we could hear them singing , He is coming , He is coming . 

<root> And they combed their long hair in preparation . 

<root> We waved and called , and they laughed and played , tantalising , their seaweed locks just out of reach . 

<root> With a flick of the tail they were off , still singing , He is coming , He is coming , until their voices were lost in the noise of the rain and the water . 

<root> A great whiskered head arose , then a belly , wet and sleek , long enough to wrap itself twice around the world . 

<root> “ Is it him ? ” we asked each other , nudging elbows and climbing onto the chairs . 

<root> We pulled off wet socks and shoes , letting them float away on the tide , before the great worm turned and the wake engulfed the creaking , cracking house . 

<root> We clambered up onto the roof , sliding on the tiles and clinging to chimney stacks , sheltering our eyes from the driving downpour . 

<root> The sky was black , and the stormy sea all the deepest , darkest blues and greens and greys and flecked with white where the sea-horses galloped . 

<root> The waters broke making way for the gnarled head of a whale , spouting water high against the clouds before opening its whiskered maw and in a looming , booming voice called : He is coming , He is coming . 

<root> The chimneys washed away , so we scrambled onto the blue-black back encrusted with barnacles and cockles like stars in a night sky and held on tight as he rode the waves , dipping and blowing , dipping and blowing . 

<root> The wind and the rain tugged at our hair . 

<root> And still it rained . 

<root> We heard a fearsome creaking and cracking and before our eyes a great patch of sky peeled away , deeping down in the troughs and riding the crests with torn sails set against the wind . 

<root> It was a galleon with masts like a dead man ’s fingers , tarred timbers groaning and a mermaid sat on the bow as he ship dipped and passed . 

<root> He is coming , He is coming , she sang out . 

<root> And just as the wash hit us , prising us from the whale ’s speckled back and down into the sea , someone threw down a knotted rope and we hung on for dear life . 

<root> The singing sailors hauled us aboard chanting , He ’s a coming - ha ! He ’s a coming - ha ! 

<root> And we fell onto the deck like fish bursting from a net . 

<root> The Captain stood above us dressed in jewels and finery from a thousand pillagings . 

<root> The Valley of Giants 

<root> I had buried my parents in their gray marble mausoleum at the heart of the city . 

<root> I had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into the mud of the bottom of the river , where all the riverboatmen lie . 

<root> And after the war , I had buried my children , all four , in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland : all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills . 

<root> I had one granddaughter who survived the war . 

<root> I saw her sometimes : in a bright pink dress , a sparkling drink in her hand , on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders , at the edge of a marble patio . 

<root> She never looked back at me — poverty and failure and political disrepute being all , these days , contagious and synonymous . 

<root> The young were mostly dead , and the old men had been taken away , they told us , to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully . 

<root> So it was a city of grandmothers . 

<root> And it was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront — sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah-jongg — that I first heard of the valley of giants . 

<root> We all laughed at the idea , except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face , who was incensed . 

<root> “ We live in the modern era ! ” she cried . 

<root> “ You should be ashamed of yourself ! " 

<root> The traveler stood up from the table . 

<root> She was bony and rough-skinned and bent like an old crow , with a blue silk scarf and hanks of hair as black as soot . 

<root> Her eyes were veined with red . 

<root> “ Nonetheless , ” the traveler said , and she walked out . 

<root> They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler . 

<root> To find anyone still proud , anyone who believed in giants or shame , was hilarious . 

<root> The air of the bar was acrid with triumph . 

<root> Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were , after everything had been taken from us — that was a delight . 

<root> But I followed the traveler , into the wet streets . 

<root> The smell of fish oozed from the docks . 

<root> Here and there were bits of charred debris in the gutters . 

<root> I caught her at her door . 

<root> She invited me in for tea and massage . 

<root> Her limbs were weathered and ringed , like the branches of trees in the dry country . 

<root> She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room , a little fermented . 

<root> A heady smell . 

<root> In the morning , brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor , and the traveler and her pack were gone . 

<root> I hurried home . 

<root> My house had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact , though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble . 

<root> My house was empty and cold . 

<root> I packed six loaves of flatbread , some olives , a hard cheese , one nice dress , walking clothes , my pills and glasses , a jug of wine , a can-teen of water , and a kitchen knife . 

<root> I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while , looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting . 

<root> That granddaughter : her parents both worked in the vineyards , and when she was a child , she would play in my courtyard in the after-noons . 

<root> When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones , she refused to cry . 

<root> She would cry from frustration when the older children could do something that she could n't — like tie knots , or catch a chicken . 

<root> Oversite 

<root> “ It does n’t hurt , Gram , ” Renata says . 

<root> My sixteen-year-old daughter pulls up her T-shirt sleeve to show her bare arm , the skin summer brown and the muscle swelling slightly into smooth biceps , flawless . 

<root> “ I had it done when I was little and see , you ca n’t even tell . ” 

<root> My mother is sitting in the little examining room at the assisted living . 

<root> Everything is white and hospital-like but there ’s no examining couch . 

<root> There ’s just a desk , a little white table with two chairs and a scale . 

<root> The doctor , a woman I do n’t know , is sitting in the other chair . 

<root> My mother is bewildered , her face turned up towards me . 

<root> She ’s got Alzheimer ’s . 

<root> “ It ’s okay , Mom , ” I say . 

<root> She wants to understand , I can see that . 

<root> So I explain again . 

<root> “ It ’s an implant that will let them know where you are , and how you are . 

<root> It wo n’t hurt . ” 

<root> Her eyes water constantly , now . 

<root> In the time it takes me to explain she grasps and loses the words , grasps and loses phrases as they go past . 

<root> She looks at me and then at Renata , who is smiling , and finally submits uncomprehendingly . 

<root> We have worn her down . 

<root> The doctor bares my mother ’s arm , where the crepey flesh hangs loosely on the bones . 

<root> The doctor swabs her upper arm with antiseptic and says , “ I ’m going to give you something to numb it , okay ? ” 

<root> To me the doctor says in her normal voice , “ It ’s just a little lidocaine . ” 

<root> I do n’t like the doctor , but I do n’t know why . 

<root> She is no-nonsense . 

<root> She has professional hair , lightly streaked . 

<root> This is no reason to dislike her . 

<root> My mother winces at the injection and is surprised again . 

<root> She looks up at me , at Renata . 

<root> We are smiling , both of us . 

<root> “ Okay , ” my mother says . 

<root> What is okay ? 

<root> I have no idea . 

<root> We wait for a few minutes . 

<root> My mother says , “ Is it time to go ? ” 

<root> “ Not yet , ” I say . 

<root> “ They ’re going to give you an injection . ” 

<root> “ What ? ” my mother says . 

<root> “ They ’re going to implant a chip . 

<root> It will help them take care of you . ” 

<root> I try to say it every time as if it was the first time I said it . 

<root> I do n’t want to embarrass her . 

<root> Her head swings around , from Renata to me to the doctor and then back to Renata . 

<root> “ It ’s okay , Gram , ” Renata says . 

<root> “ Renata , ” my mother says . 

<root> The doctor has an injection gun and while my mother is focused on my daughter , she puts it firmly against my mother ’s arm and puts the chip in . 

<root> “ Oh ! ” says my mother . 

<root> It ’s another low-grade moment of horror , but I think about that particular time with my mother because Renata was there and we were united , she and I . 

<root> So that ’s a good memory . 

<root> I come back to it a lot . 

<root> In the background , shining , is Renata , who is young and healthy and good , raising her arm to show her grandmother that the chip is nothing , nothing at all . 

<root> The last two nights I have dreamed of dogs in trouble . 

<root> I do n’t dream about Renata , although when the dreams wake me up , it ’s thinking about Renata that keeps me awake . 

<root> The first night I dreamed of seeing a stray dog and not stopping to pick it up although it was wandering in an empty parking lot near a busy road . 

<root> That was the first night Renata did n’t come home and it does n’t take Freud to figure out what that meant . 

<root> Seventeen-year-olds sleep on friends ’ couches , I know . 

<root> Or Renata might be sleeping in her car . 

<root> The second night I dreamed that I was on a desert island and Sonia , our golden retriever , was with me . 

<root> There was some horrible fate impending for Sonia and I had to kill her before something worse happened . 

<root> I laid her down on some sticks . 

<root> She trusts me , she ’s more my dog than anyone ’s , and she did n’t like it but for me she lay there . 

<root> In my dream I told her , “ Stay , Sonia . Stay . ” 

<root> She stayed because I held her there by looking at her , the way you can sometimes will a dog into submission . 

<root> She stayed while I lit the fire . 

<root> And then the horror of it all hit me and I said , “ Sonia , up ! ” 

<root> And I woke up . 

<root> That was last night , the second night Renata did n’t come home . 

<root> Prologue 

<root> " Try to touch the past . 

<root> Try to deal with the past . 

<root> It 's not real . 

<root> It 's just a dream . " 

<root> — Ted Bundy 

<root> It did n't start out here . 

<root> Not with the scramblers or Rorschach , not with Big Ben or Theseus or the vampires . 

<root> Most people would say it started with the Fireflies , but they 'd be wrong . 

<root> It ended with all those things . 

<root> For me , it began with Robert Paglino . 

<root> At the age of eight , he was my best and only friend . 

<root> We were fellow outcasts , bound by complementary misfortune . 

<root> Mine was developmental . 

<root> His was genetic : an uncontrolled genotype that left him predisposed to nearsightedness , acne , and ( as it later turned out ) a susceptibility to narcotics . 

<root> His parents had never had him optimized . 

<root> Those few TwenCen relics who still believed in God also held that one should n't try to improve upon His handiwork . 

<root> So although both of us could have been repaired , only one of us had been . 

<root> I arrived at the playground to find Pag the center of attention for some half-dozen kids , those lucky few in front punching him in the head , the others making do with taunts of mongrel and polly while waiting their turn . 

<root> I watched him raise his arms , almost hesitantly , to ward off the worst of the blows . 

<root> I could see into his head better than I could see into my own ; he was scared that his attackers might think those hands were coming up to hit back , that they 'd read it as an act of defiance and hurt him even more . 

<root> Even then , at the tender age of eight and with half my mind gone , I was becoming a superlative observer . 

<root> But I did n't know what to do . 

<root> I had n't seen much of Pag lately . 

<root> I was pretty sure he 'd been avoiding me . 

<root> Still , when your best friend 's in trouble you help out , right ? 

<root> Even if the odds are impossible — and how many eight-year-olds would go up against six bigger kids for a sandbox buddy ? — at least you call for backup . 

<root> Flag a sentry . 

<root> Something . 

<root> I just stood there . 

<root> I did n't even especially want to help him . 

<root> That did n't make sense . 

<root> Even if he had n't been my best friend , I should at least have empathized . 

<root> I 'd suffered less than Pag in the way of overt violence ; my seizures tended to keep the other kids at a distance , scared them even as they incapacitated me . 

<root> Still . 

<root> I was no stranger to the taunts and insults , or the foot that appears from nowhere to trip you up en route from A to B . 

<root> I knew how that felt . 

<root> Or I had , once . 

<root> But that part of me had been cut out along with the bad wiring . 

<root> I was still working up the algorithms to get it back , still learning by observation . 

<root> Pack animals always tear apart the weaklings in their midst . 

<root> Every child knows that much instinctively . 

<root> Maybe I should just let that process unfold , maybe I should n't try to mess with nature . 

<root> Then again , Pag 's parents had n't messed with nature , and look what it got them : a son curled up in the dirt while a bunch of engineered superboys kicked in his ribs . 

<root> In the end , propaganda worked where empathy failed . 

<root> Back then I did n't so much think as observe , did n't deduce so much as remember — and what I remembered was a thousand inspirational stories lauding anyone who ever stuck up for the underdog . 

<root> So I picked up a rock the size of my fist and hit two of Pag 's assailants across the backs of their heads before anyone even knew I was in the game . 

<root> A third , turning to face the new threat , took a blow to the face that audibly crunched the bones of his cheek . 

<root> I remember wondering why I did n't take any satisfaction from that sound , why it meant nothing beyond the fact I had one less opponent to worry about . 

<root> The rest of them ran at the sight of blood . 

<root> One of the braver promised me I was dead , shouted " Fucking zombie ! " over his shoulder as he disappeared around the corner . 

<root> Three decades it took , to see the irony in that remark . 

<root> Two of the enemy twitched at my feet . 

<root> I kicked one in the head until it stopped moving , turned to the other . 

<root> Something grabbed my arm and I swung without thinking , without looking until Pag yelped and ducked out of reach . 

<root> " Oh , " I said . 

<root> " Sorry . " 

<root> One thing lay motionless . 

<root> The other moaned and held its head and curled up in a ball . 

<root> " Oh shit , " Pag panted . 

<root> Blood coursed unheeded from his nose and splattered down his shirt . 

<root> His cheek was turning blue and yellow . 

<root> " Oh shit oh shit oh shit ... " 

<root> I thought of something to say . 

<root> " You all right ? " 

<root> " Oh shit , you — I mean , you never ... " 

<root> He wiped his mouth . 

<root> Blood smeared the back of his hand . 

<root> " Oh man are we in trouble . " 

<root> " They started it . " 

<root> " Yeah , but you — I mean , look at them ! " 

<root> The moaning thing was crawling away on all fours . 

<root> I wondered how long it would be before it found reinforcements . 

<root> I wondered if I should kill it before then . 

<root> " You 'd a never done that before , " Pag said . 

<root> Before the operation , he meant . 

<root> I actually did feel something then — faint , distant , but unmistakable . 

<root> I felt angry . 

<root> " They started — " 

<root> Pag backed away , eyes wide . 

<root> " What are you doing ? 

<root> Put that down ! " 

<root> I 'd raised my fists . 

<root> I did n't remember doing that . 

<root> I unclenched them . 

<root> It took a while . 

<root> I had to look at my hands very hard for a long , long time . 

<root> The rock dropped to the ground , blood-slick and glistening . 

<root> " I was trying to help . " 

<root> I did n't understand why he could n't see that . 

<root> " You 're , you 're not the same , " Pag said from a safe distance . 

<root> " You 're not even Siri any more . " 

<root> " I am too . 

<root> Do n't be a fuckwad . " 

<root> " They cut out your brain ! " 

<root> " Only half . 

<root> For the ep — " 

<root> " I know for the epilepsy ! 

<root> You think I do n't know ? 

<root> But you were in that half — or , like , part of you was ... " 

<root> He struggled with the words , with the concept behind them . 

<root> " And now you 're different . 

<root> It 's like , your mom and dad murdered you — " 

<root> " My mom and dad , " I said , suddenly quiet , " saved my life . 

<root> I would have died . " 

<root> " I think you did die , " said my best and only friend . 

<root> " I think Siri died , they scooped him out and threw him away and you 're some whole other kid that just , just grew back out of what was left . 

<root> You 're not the same . 

<root> Ever since . 

<root> You 're not the same . " 

<root> Stranger Things Happen - 

<root> Water Off a Black Dog ’s Back 

<root> Rachel Rook took Carroll home to meet her parents two months after she first slept with him . 

<root> For a generous girl , a girl who took off her clothes with abandon , she was remarkably close-mouthed about some things . 

<root> In two months Carroll had learned that her parents lived on a farm several miles outside of town ; that they sold strawberries in summer , and Christmas trees in the winter . 

<root> He knew that they never left the farm ; instead , the world came to them in the shape of weekend picnickers and driveby tourists . 

<root> Do you think your parents will like me ? " he said . 

<root> He had spent the afternoon preparing for this visit as carefully as if he were preparing for an exam . 

<root> He had gotten his hair cut , trimmed his nails , washed his neck and behind his ears . 

<root> The outfit he had chosen , khaki pants and a blue button-down shirt -- no tie -- lay neatly folded on the bed . 

<root> He stood before Rachel in his plain white underwear and white socks , gazing at her as if she were a mirror . 

<root> " No , " she said . 

<root> It was the first time she had been to his apartment , and she stood square in the center of his bedroom , her arms folded against her body as if she was afraid to sit down , to touch something . 

<root> " Why ? " 

<root> " My father will like you , " she said . 

<root> " But he likes everyone . 

<root> My mother 's more particular -- 

<root> she thinks that you lack a serious nature . " 

<root> Carroll put on his pants , admiring the crease . 

<root> " So you 've talked to her about me . " 

<root> " Yes . " 

<root> " But you have n't talked about her to me . " 

<root> " No . " 

<root> " Are you ashamed of her ? " 

<root> Rachel snorted . 

<root> Then she sighed in a way that seemed to suggest she was regretting her decision to take him home . 

<root> " You 're ashamed of me , " he guessed , and Rachel kissed him and smiled and did n't say anything . 

<root> Rachel still lived on her parents ' farm , which made it all the more remarkable that she had kept Carroll and her parents apart for so long . 

<root> It suggested a talent for daily organization that filled Carroll 's heart with admiration and lust . 

<root> She was nineteen , two years younger than Carroll ; she was a student at Jellicoh College and every weekday she rose at seven and biked four miles into town , and then back again on her bike , four miles uphill to the farm . 

<root> Carroll met Rachel in the Jellicoh College library , where he had a part-time job . 

<root> He sat at the checkout desk , stamping books and reading Tristram Shandy for a graduate class ; he was almost asleep when someone said , " Excuse me . " 

<root> He looked up . 

<root> The girl who stood before the tall desk was red-headed . 

<root> Sunlight streaming in through a high window opposite her lit up the fine hairs on her arm , the embroidered flowers on the collar of her white shirt . 

<root> The sunlight turned her hair to fire and Carroll found it difficult to look directly at her . 

<root> " Can I help you ? " he said . 

<root> She placed a shredded rectangle on the desk , and Carroll picked it up between his thumb and forefinger . 

<root> Pages hung in tatters from the sodden blue spine . 

<root> Title , binding , and covers had been gnawed away . 

<root> " I need to pay for a damaged book , " she said . 

<root> " What happened ? Did your dog eat it ? " he said , making a joke . 

<root> " Yes , " she said , and smiled . 

<root> " What 's your name ? " Carroll said . 

<root> Already , he thought he might be in love . 

<root> Does n’t it make you just want to sneeze ? 

<root> Pete was leaning against the wall , watching the street go by . 

<root> I pulled the bike to a halt , the front wheel pointing in his direction . 

<root> “ I think I ’ve got a fairy stuck up my nose . ” 

<root> “ S’ not true ! ” came a voice from inside the nose in question . 

<root> “ Hey ! Not bad that ! ” Pete said . 

<root> “ I did n’t see your lips move at all . ” 

<root> “ It ’s not a joke . ” 

<root> The itching was getting worse . 

<root> I pulled out a paper tissue . 

<root> “ Stop that now ! ” came the voice again . 

<root> “ You know I do n’t like it . ” 

<root> “ S’ not my fault . 

<root> You make me want to sneeze ! ” 

<root> And I did . 

<root> I inspected the crumpled paper . 

<root> Lots of yellow goo , but no fairy . 

<root> Pete looked at me with mild disgust as I eyed the handkerchief more closely . 

<root> “ You know that ’s pretty gross … ” he said . 

<root> “ Got any other brilliant remarks ? ” I said . 

<root> I held a finger up to my lips , and waved a hand to silence Pete ’s reply . 

<root> “ Are you still there ? ” I called . 

<root> “ No thanks to you ! ” came the little voice . 

<root> Pete looked at me sort of sideways . 

<root> “ Look , the first time was OK , but — ” 

<root> “ It ’s not a joke . 

<root> I ’ve really got something stuck up there . 

<root> I was riding on me bike and I thought I ’d swallowed an insect or something . 

<root> And then it started insulting me . ” 

<root> “ You ’re having me on , right ? ” 

<root> “ Pete ! 

<root> Look at me . 

<root> If it ’s a trick , how do I do it then ? ” 

<root> Pete thought for a moment . 

<root> “ If it ’s real … Are n’t they supposed to have a pot of gold or something ? 

<root> And they have to tell you where it is if you catch them ? ” 

<root> “ That ’s leprechauns , idiot ! ” said the voice from my noise . 

<root> “ So what ’s the difference ? 

<root> Just give us the gold and we ’ll let you go … ” 

<root> “ We — ? ” I started . 

<root> He winked at me . 

<root> “ Oh , I ’m happy to stick around , ” came the voice . 

<root> “ It ’s noggins here who wants to get rid of me … ” 

<root> Suddenly I felt a violent pain in my nose , my eyes watered . 

<root> “ Owwww ! ” I howled . 

<root> “ See what I mean ? ” the voice shouted over my moans . 

<root> “ Perhaps you can use it in exams … ” Pete said , scratching his head . 

<root> “ You know , it could tell us all the answers . ” 

<root> “ Idiot ! 

<root> If it yacks on like that in an exam , I ’ll get thrown out . 

<root> And probably locked up too . ” 

<root> “ Ca n’t it whisper ? ” 

<root> “ Perhaps I do n’t know the answers anyway ? ” said the voice . 

<root> “ Have you thought of that ? ” 

<root> “ Anyway , I do n’t want it in exams . 

<root> I just want it to go . 

<root> Out of my nose . ” 

<root> “ Ca n’t you just poke it out ? ” 

<root> “ With what ? ” 

<root> “ S’pose you ’ve already tried your finger … ” 

<root> “ Yes he has , ” the voice said . 

<root> “ And it was n’t pleasant I can tell you . ” 

<root> “ You see what it ’s like . 

<root> He ’s already making sarcastic remarks like that … ” 

<root> “ What if we put something in your nose to catch it , then ? 

<root> I do n’t know … A spider ? ” 

<root> “ No ! ” we both said at once . 

<root> “ Snap ! ” Pete said . 

<root> “ You both said the same thing at the same time , you ’ve got to make a — ” He hit his forehead with his palm . 

<root> “ That ’s it ! 

<root> Three wishes ! 

<root> When you catch a fairy , you get three wishes . 

<root> Hey you in there ! 

<root> Is that right ? ” 

<root> “ You could see things like that … ” said the voice with resignation . 

<root> “ I wish you ’d get out of my nose , then ! ” I cried . 

<root> In a flash the fairy was out of my nose and gone . 

<root> And I ’m still waiting for my two other wishes . 

<root> THE END 

<root> Something a little lighter this week , I hope you enjoy it . 

<root> Once it got started , I realised that the idea must have been inspired by the title of Justine Larbalestier ’s How to Ditch Your Fairy , although it has nothing at all to do with that story at all . 

<root> All in all , my story feels very light . 

<root> But I think I needed something a little less dark , and there are some quite sombre tales coming up in the coming weeks . 

<root> See you then . 

<root> The Cost to Be Wise 

<root> Veronique stayed with me that night , lying next to me in my blankets and furs . 

<root> She did n't sleep , I do n't think . 

<root> I was listening to her breath . 

<root> I felt as if I should help her sleep . 

<root> I lay there and tried to think if I should put my arm around her , but I did n't know . 

<root> Maybe she did n't want to be touched . 

<root> And she had been a stupid girl , anyway . 

<root> She lay tense in the dark . 

<root> " Are you going to be a teacher ? " I asked . 

<root> She laughed . 

<root> " If I get out of here . " 

<root> I waited for her to say more , but she did n't . 

<root> " Get out of here " meant to make someone leave . 

<root> Maybe she meant if she made herself . 

<root> " You come here from Earth ? " I asked . 

<root> To get her to talk , although I was tired of lingua and I did n't really want to think about anything . 

<root> " My family came here from Earth , " she said . 

<root> " Why ? " 

<root> " My father , he 's an anthropologist , " she said . 

<root> " Do you know anthropologist ? " 

<root> " No , " I said . 

<root> " He is a person who studies the way people live . 

<root> And he is a teacher . " 

<root> All the offworlders I had ever met were teachers . 

<root> I wondered who did all the work on Earth . 

<root> " Because Earth had lost touch with your world , the people here are very interesting to my father , " she said . 

<root> Her voice was listless in the dark and she was even harder to understand when I could n't see her properly . 

<root> I did n't understand so I did n't say anything . 

<root> I was sorry I 'd started her talking . 

<root> " History , do you know the word ' history ' ? " she asked . 

<root> Of course I knew the word " history . " 

<root> " I study history in school , " I said . 

<root> Anneal and Kumar taught it . 

<root> " Do you know the history of this world ? " 

<root> It took my tired head a long time to sort that out . 

<root> " Yes , " I said . 

<root> " We are a colony . 

<root> People from Earth come here to live . 

<root> Then there is a big problem on Earth , and the people of Earth forget we are here . 

<root> We forget we are from Earth . 

<root> Then Earth finds us again . " 

<root> " Some people have stories about coming from the Earth , " Veronique said . 

<root> " My father is collecting those stories from different peoples . 

<root> I 'm a graduate student . " 

<root> The clans did n't have any stories about coming from Earth . 

<root> We said the first people came out of the sun . 

<root> This somehow seemed embarrassing . 

<root> I did n't understand what kind of student she was . 

<root> " Are you here for stories ? " I asked . 

<root> " No , " she said . 

<root> " Ian is old friends with your teacher , from back when they were both with the survey . 

<root> We just came to visit . " 

<root> I did n't understand what she 'd said except that they were visiting . 

<root> We were quiet after that . 

<root> I pretended to sleep . 

<root> Sometimes there was gunfire outside and we jumped , even Mam on the bed . 

<root> Everyone but Bet . 

<root> Once Bet was asleep it was impossible to wake her up . 

<root> I fell asleep thinking about how I wished that the Scathalos outrunners were gone . 

<root> I dreamed that I was at the offworlder 's home , where it was summer but no one was taking care of the stabros , and they were all glad , and so I was a hero - and I was startled awake by gunfire . 

<root> Just more drinking and shooting . 

<root> I wished my da would come home . 

<root> It did n't seem fair that we should lie here and be afraid while the men were getting drunk and singing . 

<root> The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz 

<root> A ROMANCE IN EIGHT DAYS by JOHANN VALENTIN ANDREAE in a new version by JOHN CROWLEY illustrated by THEO FADEL 

<root> SMALL BEER PRESS EASTHAMPTON , MASS . 

<root> Introduction 

<root> I 

<root> The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz is the way I ’ve decided to present the title of this book . 

<root> Most versions in English are called The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz , which suggests ( and most people who ’ve heard of it suppose ) that the wedding is Christian ’s . 

<root> It ’s not ; Christian Rosencreutz is the purported author of a book called The Chemical Wedding . 

<root> The actual author is Johann Valentin Andreae , whose name did n’t appear on the book originally , thus ensuring the confusion . 

<root> I ’ll call it herein ( as everyone mostly does ) simply The Chemical Wedding . 

<root> Though its original readers would have had a certain amount of context for the truly bizarre and surprising events it tells of , it ’s possible that The Chemical Wedding is now more enjoyable without knowing that context , and experiencing the book unmediated . 

<root> You might therefore wish to start right in on the first page of text that follows and only then return to this introduction . 

<root> Consider a similar case : a little book published in 1934 by the Surrealist artist Max Ernst called Une Semaine de Bonté . 

<root> It was made entirely of collaged illustrations cut out of old books 

<root> The First Day 

<root> It was just before Easter Sunday , 1 and I was sitting at my table . 

<root> I ’d said my prayers , talking a long time as usual with my Maker and thinking about some of the great mysteries the Father of Lights had revealed to me . 

<root> Now I was ready to make and to bake – only in my heart , actually – a small , perfect unleavened wafer to eat with my beloved Paschal Lamb . 

<root> All of a sudden a terrible wind blew up , so strong that I thought the hill my little house was built on would be blown apart – but I ’d seen the Devil do things as bad as this before ( the Devil had often tried to harm me ) , so I took heart and went on meditating . 

<root> Till I felt somebody touch me on the back . 

<root> This frightened me so that I did n’t dare turn . 

<root> I tried to stay as brave and calm as a human being could under the circumstances . 

<root> I felt my coat tugged at , and tugged again , and at last I looked around . 

<root> A woman stood there , so bright and beautiful , in a sky-colored robe – a heavens covered with 

<root> 1 Christian ’s story begins just before Easter , like Dante ’s Divine Comedy . 

<root> It can be seen as an allegory of Christ ’s death and resurrection , though this idea produces some puzzles . 

<root> The birds sang so beautifully , the young deer skipped so happily , that it gladdened my old heart , and I could n't help singing too ... 

<root> THE FOURTH DAY 

<root> I was awake and lying in bed next morning , looking idly at the wonderful images and inscriptions all around my room , when suddenly I heard the sound of trumpets , as if a procession were already underway . 

<root> My page jumped out of bed as if crazed , looking more dead than alive , and you can imagine how I felt when he cried , “ They 're already being presented to the king ! " 

<root> I could only groan in frustration and curse my lazy bones . 

<root> I got dressed , but my page was quicker than I was and ran out of the chamber to see what was what . 

<root> He soon came back and gave me the good news that I actually had n’t overslept ; all I ’d done was miss breakfast : they had n’t wanted to wake an old man who needed his rest . 

<root> But now I had to get ready to go with him to the lion fountain , where most of the others were gathered . 

<root> Such a relief ! 

<root> My spirits recovered , and as soon as I had got into my habit , I followed him to the garden I have already told about . 

<root> I found that the lion , in place of his sword , now held a rather large plaque . 

<root> Examining this , I could tell that it had been taken from those ancient monuments I ’d seen and put here for some special reason . 

<root> The inscription on it was fading away , so I should set it down here as it was then , and ask my readers to ponder it : 

<root> Prince Hermes : Now after humankind has suffered so much harm here I flow having by god ’s counsel and with the help of art become a healing balm . 

<root> Drink from me if you can ; wash , if you like ; trouble my waters if you dare . 

<root> Drink , Brethren ! 

<root> Drink and live ! 

<root> Biologist Nick Bos tells Wikinews about ' self-medicating ' ants 

<root> Tuesday , September 1 , 2015 

<root> Formica fusca , from file . 

<root> Image : Mathias Krumbholz . 

<root> Nick Bos , of the University of Helsinki , studies " the amazing adaptations social insects have evolved in order to fight the extreme parasite pressure they experience " . 

<root> In a recently-accepted Evolution paper Bos and colleagues describe ants appearing to self-medicate . 

<root> " I have no doubt that as time goes on , there will be more and more cases documented " 

<root> The team used Formica fusca , an ant species that can form thousand-strong colonies . 

<root> This common black ant eats other insects , and also aphid honeydew . 

<root> It often nests in tree stumps or under rocks and foraging workers can sometimes be spotted climbing trees . 

<root> Some ants were infected with Beauveria bassiana , a fungus . 

<root> Infected ants chose food laced with toxic hydrogen peroxide , whereas healthy ants avoided it . 

<root> Hydrogen peroxide reduced infected ant fatalities by 15 % , and the ants varied their intake depending upon how high the peroxide concentration was . 

<root> In the wild , Formica fusca can encounter similar chemicals in aphids and dead ants . 

<root> The Independent reported self-medicating ants a first among insects . 

<root> Bos obtained his doctorate from the University of Copenhagen . 

<root> He began postdoctoral research at Helsinki in 2012 . 

<root> He also runs the AntyScience blog . 

<root> The blog aims to help address " a gap between scientists and ' the general public ' . " 

<root> The name is a pun referencing ants , its primary topic , science , and " non-scientific " jargon-free communication . 

<root> He now discusses his work with Wikinews . 

<root> Beauveria bassiana on a cicada in Bolivia . 

<root> Image : Danny Newman . 

<root> What first attracted you to researching ants ? 

<root> Me and a studymate were keeping a lot of animals during our studies , from beetles , to butterflies and mantids , to ants . 

<root> We had the ants in an observation nest , and I could just look at them for hours , watching them go about . 

<root> This was in my third year of Biology study I think . 

<root> After a while I needed to start thinking about an internship for my M.Sc. studies , and decided to write a couple of professors . 

<root> I ended up going to the Centre for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen where I did a project on learning in Ants under supervision of Prof. Patrizia d'Ettorre . 

<root> I liked it so much there I ended up doing a PhD and I 've been working on social insects ever since . 

<root> What methods and equipment were used for this investigation ? 

<root> This is a fun one . 

<root> I try to work on a very low budget , and like to build most of the experimental setups myself ( we actually have equipment in the lab nicknamed the ' Nickinator ' , ' i-Nick ' and the ' Nicktendo64 ' ) . 

<root> There 's not that much money in fundamental science at the moment , so I try to cut the costs wherever possible . 

<root> We collected wild colonies of Formica fusca by searching through old tree-trunks in old logging sites in southern Finland . 

<root> We then housed the ants in nests I made using Y-tong [ aerated concrete ] . 

<root> It 's very soft stone that you can easily carve . 

<root> We carved out little squares for the ants to live in ( covered with old CD covers to prevent them escaping ! ) . 

<root> We then drilled a tunnel to a pot ( the foraging arena ) , where the ants got the choice between the food with medicine and the food without . 

<root> We infected the ants by preparing a solution of the fungus Beauveria bassiana . 

<root> Afterwards , each ant was dipped in the solution for a couple of seconds , dried on a cloth and put in the nest . 

<root> After exposing the ants to the fungus , we took pictures of each foraging arena three times per day , and counted how many ants were present on each food-source . 

<root> Example of aerated concrete , which provided a home for the subjects . 

<root> Image : Marco Bernardini . 

<root> This gave us the data that ants choose more medicine after they have been infected . 

<root> The result that healthy ants die sooner when ingesting ROS [ Reactive Oxygen Species , the group of chemicals that includes hydrogen peroxide ] but infected ants die less was obtained in another way ( as you have to ' force feed ' the ROS , as healthy ants , when given the choice , ignore that food-source . ) 

<root> For this we basically put colonies on a diet of either food with medicine or without for a while . 

<root> And afterwards either infected them or not . Then for about two weeks we count every day how many ants died . 

<root> This gives us the data to do a so-called survival analysis . 

<root> We measured the ROS-concentration in the bodies of ants after they ingested the food with the medicine using a spectrophotometer . 

<root> By adding certain chemicals , the ROS can be measured using the emission of light of a certain wave-length . 

<root> The detrimental effect of ROS on spores was easy to measure . 

<root> We mixed different concentrations of ROS with the spores , plated them out on petridishes with an agar-solution where fungus can grow on . 

<root> A day after , we counted how many spores were still alive . 

<root> How reliable do you consider your results to be ? 

<root> The results we got are very reliable . 

<root> We had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants , and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind . 

<root> This means the experimenter does n't know which ants belong to which treatment , so it 's impossible to influence the results with ' observer bias ' . 

<root> However , of course this is proof in just one species . 

<root> It is hard to extrapolate to other ants , as different species lead very different lives . 

<root> Wikinews interviews President of the International Brotherhood of Magicians 

<root> Wednesday , October 9 , 2013 

<root> October is National Magic Month in the United States . 

<root> Wikinews spoke with William Evans , president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians , about the current state of magic and what its future looks like in the world of entertainment . 

<root> For how long have you been involved in performing / studying magic ? 

<root> Over 50 years . 

<root> I am 61 now so I really started when I was about 10 years old even though I had seen and worked with some basic tricks a few years earlier . 

<root> I remember going into Hollywood Magic and wanting that big red box with the dragons on it and I did n't even know what it did . 

<root> The magician behind the counter was wise enough not to sell it to me , but instead sold me two books which I still own today - " Scarne on Card Tricks " and " Scarne on Magic Tricks " . 

<root> That started me out on books and I have amassed quite a few since then . 

<root> My major influences on performance are Eugene Burger and Michael Skinner . 

<root> October is National Magic Month in the US . 

<root> Do you think magic is alive as a viable form of entertainment today ? 

<root> Absolutely . 

<root> There are more magicians working today than ever before . 

<root> There will always be an audience for good magicians doing good magic . 

<root> Has the internet helped or hurt magic ? 

<root> Both . 

<root> I think it has helped draw younger people to magic as a hobby , but I think it has hurt the ability of young magicians to think because so many rely on the internet for everything and they are n't reading the books . 

<root> We have to have knowledge of the history of magic and what has been done before . 

<root> Moreover , seeing someone perform on the internet takes away the use of our senses , originality and imagination that reading and thinking about magic can produce . 

<root> Anyone can become a monkey ; it takes serious study to become a magician . 

<root> Do you travel much in your current role ? 

<root> Yes , I am traveling quite a bit . 

<root> After I was inducted as International President in Phoenix in July , I have been to the Jeff McBride Experience in Eureka Springs , Arkansas , Magic Live in Las Vegas , The Midwest Magic Jubilee in St. Louis , the TAOM in Dallas , the British Ring Convention in Buxton , England and the Magic Circle in London . 

<root> I am going to Las Vegas and Los Angeles next month , Italy in November , back to Las Vegas in December , Mexico in January , Magi-Fest in February , the Winter Carnival of Magic in Tennessee in March , Eureka Springs Cavalcade of Magic in March , and the FFFF in April . 

<root> That 's as of now .

<root> Interview with US political activist and philosopher Noam Chomsky 

<root> Saturday , April 4 , 2009 

<root> Political activist and philosopher Noam Chomsky 

<root> Noam Chomsky is a professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Linguistics and Philosophy . 

<root> At the age of 40 he was credited with revolutionizing the field of modern linguistics . 

<root> He was one of the first opponents of the Vietnam War , and is a self-described Libertarian Socialist . 

<root> At age 80 he continues to write books ; his latest book , Hegemony or Survival , was a bestseller in non-fiction . 

<root> According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index Professor Chomsky is the eighth most cited scholar of all time . 

<root> On March 13 , Professor Chomsky sat down with Michael Dranove for an interview in his MIT office in Cambridge , Massachusetts . 

<root> On NATO 

<root> I just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on recent NATO actions and the protests coming up at the 60th NATO conference , I know you ’re speaking at the counter-conference . 

<root> Could be I give so many talks I ca n’t remember . 

<root> On the NATO conference , well I mean the obvious question is why should NATO exist ? 

<root> In fact you can ask questions about why it should ever have existed , but now why should it exist . 

<root> I mean the theory was , whether you believe it or not , that it would be a defensive alliance against potential Soviet aggression , that ’s the basic doctrine . 

<root> Well there ’s no defense against Soviet aggression , so whether you believe that doctrine or not that ’s gone . 

<root> When the Soviet Union collapsed there had been an agreement , a recent agreement , between Gorbachev and the U.S government and the first Bush administration . 

<root> The agreement was that Gorbachev agreed to a quite remarkable concession : he agreed to let a united Germany join the NATO military alliance . 

<root> Now it is remarkable in the light of history , the history of the past century , Germany alone had virtually destroyed Russia , twice , and Germany backed by a hostile military alliance , centered in the most phenomenal military power in history , that ’s a real threat . 

<root> Nevertheless he agreed , but there was a quid pro quo , namely that NATO should not expand to the east , so Russia would at least have a kind of security zone . 

<root> And George Bush and James Baker , secretary of state , agreed that NATO would not expand one inch to the east . 

<root> Gorbachev also proposed a nuclear free weapons zone in the region , but the U.S would n’t consider that . 

<root> Okay , so that was the basis on which then shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed . 

<root> Well , Clinton came into office what did he do ? 

<root> Well one of the first things he did was to back down on the promise of not expanding NATO to the east . 

<root> Well that ’s a significant threat to the Soviet Union , to Russia now that there was no longer any Soviet Union , it was a significant threat to Russia and not surprisingly they responded by beefing up their offensive capacity , not much but some . 

<root> So they rescinded their pledge not to use nuclear weapons on first strike , NATO had never rescinded it , but they had and started some remilitarization . 

<root> With Bush , the aggressive militarism of the Bush administration , as predicted , induced Russia to extend further its offensive military capacity ; it ’s still going on right now . 

<root> When Bush proposed the missile defense systems in Eastern Europe , Poland and Czechoslovakia , it was a real provocation to the Soviet Union . 

<root> I mean that was discussed in U.S arms control journals , that they would have to regard as a potential threat to their strategic deterrent , meaning as a first strike weapon . 

<root> And the claim was that it had to do with Iranian missiles , but forget about that . 

<root> Take say on Obama , Obama ’s national security advisor James Jones former Marine commandant is on record of favoring expansion of NATO to the south and the east , further expansion of NATO , and also making it an intervention force . 

<root> And the head of NATO , Hoop Scheffer , he has explained that NATO must take on responsibility for ensuring the security of pipelines and sea lanes , that is NATO must be a guarantor of energy supplies for the West . 

<root> Well that ’s kind of an unending war , so do we want NATO to exist , do we want there to be a Western military alliance that carries out these activities , with no pretense of defense ? 

<root> Well I think that ’s a pretty good question ; I do n’t see why it should , I mean there happens to be no other military alliance remotely comparable — if there happened to be one I ’d be opposed to that too . 

<root> So I think the first question is , what is this all about , why should we even be debating NATO , is there any reason why it should exist ? 

<root> Labor actions as a revival of the Left 

<root> We ’ve seen mass strikes all around the world , in countries that we would n’t expect it . 

<root> Do you think this is a revival of the Left in the West ? 

<root> Or do you think it ’s nothing ? 

<root> It ’s really hard to tell . 

<root> I mean there ’s certainly signs of it , and in the United States too , in fact we had a sit down strike in the United States not long ago , which is a very militant labor action . 

<root> Sit down strikes which began at a significant level in the 1930’s were very threatening to management and ownership , because the sit down strike is one step before workers taking over the factory and running it and kicking out the management , and probably doing a better job . 

<root> So that ’s a frightening idea , and police were called in and so on . 

<root> Well we just had one in the United States at the Republic Windows and Doors Factory , it ’s hard to know , I mean these things are just hard to predict , they may take off , and they may take on a broader scope , they may fizzle away or be diverted . 

<root> Wikinews interviews New York bar owner on Santorum cocktail 

<root> Thursday , March 15 , 2012 

<root> Wikinews interviewed one of the owners of a New York City bar about a popular new politically-themed cocktail drink called Santorum . 

<root> The beverage was inspired by the santorum neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage 's column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality ; 

<root> Savage 's readers voted to define santorum as ; " the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex . " 

<root> Background 

<root> The santorum neologism has inspired satirical forms of parody , including this political cartoon by Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal webcomic artist Zach Weiner . 

<root> 2012 . 

<root> Image ; Zach Weiner . 

<root> The Pacific Standard bar is located in Brooklyn , New York , and is co-owned by Jonathan M. Stan and John-Christian G. Rauschenberg . 

<root> Stan commented on the creation of the Santorum cocktail , " When he was winning in the polls , I thought , ' OK , I 'll do a Santorum ' . " 

<root> Regarding how long the beverage will be made available , Stan remarked to The Brooklyn Paper , " We 'll keep it around until he ’s irrelevant . I hope he ’s there the whole way " . 

<root> The main ingredients of the Santorum drink include vodka of an orange citrus variety , Baileys Irish Cream , and Angostura bitters . 

<root> It is served in a cocktail glass and topped with Godiva chocolate flakes . 

<root> The beverage is priced at US $ 8.00 , and upon an order for it , the bartender will recount for the customer the definition of the santorum neologism . 

<root> Troy Patterson of Slate Magazine ventured over to Pacific Standard to sample the new santorum cocktail at the bar . 

<root> After tasting the beverage , Patterson observed , " My Santorum was sweet but balanced , with a subtle citrus pucker " . 

<root> [ The santorum neologism is ] offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . — Rick Santorum 

<root> In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press , Rick Santorum compared legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality . 

<root> Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator ’s last name , and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon . 

<root> The term became a prominent result in searches online , and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google , Bing , and Yahoo! . 

<root> Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon ; he was quoted by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google 's response ; 

<root> " To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they ca n't handle . 

<root> I suspect that 's not true . " 

<root> Santorum criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview , saying , " It 's offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . "

<root> Interview 

<root> What inspired you to create a cocktail after the santorum neologism ? 

<root> Santorum the person has been in the news throughout the primary season , and we thought it would be interesting to try to create a delicious drink that mimicked the appearance of the Dan Savage meaning of " santorum . " 

<root> How did you first hear about the definition of the santorum neologism that grew out of the contest from the Savage Love advice column ? 

<root> We do n't really remember . 

<root> It 's been around forever . 

<root> Probably read about it somewhere . 

<root> What are your thoughts about Rick Santorum ’s views on gay rights ? 

<root> It 's not for us to take a stand on any political issues . 

<root> We 'll leave that to the professionals . 

<root> Do you think it was an appropriate form of satire for Dan Savage to popularize the definition of the santorum neologism created in his advice column ? 

<root> We thought it was funny . 

<root> Whether it is appropriate or not is another thing we leave to the pros to decide . 

<root> When was the Santorum cocktail first created ? 

<root> A few months ago . 

<root> What ingredients go in the Santorum cocktail ? 

<root> Bailey 's , orange vodka , bitters , and chocolate flakes . 

<root> How is the Santorum drink made ? 

<root> The ingredients are shaken and/or poured into a cocktail glass . 

<root> See the pictures . 

<root> Your Santorum cocktail creation has already received media coverage from publications including ; The Brooklyn Paper , The New York Times , Jezebel , Metro.us , EDGE on the Net , and Instinct Magazine . 

<root> Did you think when you created it that the Santorum cocktail would receive this news coverage ? 

<root> Not at all . 

<root> We were just trying to come up with a topical and funny new cocktail for our customers to laugh about and enjoy . 

<root> What culinary dishes would you recommend that go well with the Santorum cocktail ? 

<root> You 'd probably be having the cocktail at dessert time , so something sweet ; ice cream or pie . 

<root> Is the drink popular ? 

<root> How many times do you suppose you ’ve served it at your establishment since its creation ? 

<root> The drink was mildly popular for the last few months , but of course has become a great deal more popular since getting all this publicity . 

<root> We have no way to estimate how many times we 've served it overall , but we 're now pouring around ten a night . 

<root> Cold as ice : Wikinews interviews Marymegan Daly on unusual new sea anemone 

<root> Tuesday , January 21 , 2014 

<root> How did you come to be involved with this discovery 

<root> Frank Rack got in touch after they returned from Antarctica in hopes that I could help with an identification on the anemone . 

<root> What was your first reaction upon learning there was an undiscovered ecosystem under the ice in the Ross Sea ? 

<root> I was amazed and really excited . 

<root> I think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate , because it implies that there was a well-founded expectation of something . 

<root> The technology that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important because , given our lack of data , we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like , or what it should n't be like . 

<root> There 's a return trip planned hopefully for 2015 , with both biologists and ANDRILL geologists . 

<root> Are you intending to go there yourself ? 

<root> I would love to . 

<root> But I am also happy to not go , as long as someone collects more animals on my behalf ! 

<root> What I want to do with the animals requires new material preserved in diverse ways , but it does n't require me to be there . 

<root> Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live , and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones , ship time is expensive , especially in Antarctica , and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there , they should have priority to be there . 

<root> These animals are shrouded in mystery . 

<root> Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical ; do they produce some kind of antifreeze , and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own ? 

<root> Talk us through the difficulties encountered when trying to find answers with the specimens on hand . 

<root> The samples we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in formalin ( a kind of formaldehyde solution ) . 

<root> The formalin is great for preserving structures , but for anemones , it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body . 

<root> This means we ca n't look at the issue you raise with these animals . 

<root> What we could do , however , was to study anatomy and figure out what it is , so that when we have samples preserved for studying e.g. , the genome , transcriptome , or metabolome , or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves , we can make precise comparisons , and figure out what these animals have or do ( metabolically or chemically ) that lets them live where they live . 

<root> Just knowing a whole lot about a single species is n't very useful , even if that animal is as special as these clearly are - 

<root> we need to know what about them is different and thus related to living in this strange way . 

<root> The only way to get at what 's different is to make comparisons with close relatives . 

<root> We can start that side of the work now , anticipating having more beasts in the future . 

<root> In terms of their glow , I suspect that it 's not theirs - 

<root> although luminescence is common in anemone relatives , they do n't usually make light themselves . 

<root> They do make a host of florescent proteins , and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow . 

<root> What analysis did you perform on the specimens and what equipment was used ? 

<root> I used a dissecting scope to look at the animal 's external anatomy and overall body organization ( magnification of 60 X ) . 

<root> I embedded a few of the animals in wax and then cut them into very thin slices using a microtome , mounted the slices on microscope slides , stained the slices to enhance contrast , and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope 

<root> ( that 's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper ) . 

<root> I used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue to see the stinging capsules ( = nematocysts ) . 

<root> I compared the things I saw under the 'scopes to what had been published on other species in this group . 

<root> This step seems trivial , but it is really the most important part ! 

<root> By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found , I figured out what group it belongs to , and was able to determine that within that group , it was a new species . 

<root> It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication , why did it take so long ? 

<root> You mean , how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly , right ? :) 

<root> It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out . 

<root> Some of that time was just lost time - 

<root> I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish . 

<root> Once we figured out what it was , we played a lot of manuscript email tag , which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel , field work , etc. 

<root> Manuscript review and processing took about four months . 

<root> What sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used , and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact DNA ? 

<root> The preservation was not unorthodox - 

<root> they followed best practices for anatomical preservation . 

<root> Having DNA-suitable material will let us see whether there are new genes , or genes turned on in different ways and at different times that help explain how these animals burrow into hard ice and then survive in the cold . 

<root> I am curious about the population structure of the " fields " of anemones - 

<root> the group to which Edwardsiella andrillae belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually , and it 's possible that the fields are " clones " produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction . 

<root> DNA is the only way to test this . 

<root> This map shows the location of the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic , and the two known localities for E. andrillae relative to McMurdo Station

<root> BDSM as business : An interview with the owners of a dungeon 

<root> Sunday , October 21 , 2007 

<root> Operating the business 

<root> The costs 

<root> Clothing supply closet . 

<root> There 's a misconception in this industry . 

<root> Your exposure to this is probably primarily what you see in movies , scanning magazines , scanning the Internet , just snippets everywhere . 

<root> It 's portrayed as though it 's dark , black and evil . 

<root> And -- 

<root> Oh man , well ? 

<root> What 's up ? 

<root> I do wear a lot of black . 

<root> It 's anything but that . 

<root> If you look at the rooms , there 's all the accouterments you 'd find in these types of places -- 

<root> but more than anything , there 's a lot of good feeling around here . 

<root> We hire the opposite of what you 'd think we would hire , what the average person would think we would hire . 

<root> We hire educated , nice people . 

<root> I remember one of our ads that I had put in said , " If you think nice girls do n't do S&M , " -- I forgot what the rest of it said -- 

<root> " -- think again . " 

<root> Yeah , " think again " or something like that . 

<root> And that ad had pulled so many girls , because they -- I think they all thought that nice girls do n't do this . 

<root> And a bunch of them had called and they said , " Wow . " 

<root> And I think I remember , a bunch of guys called because of that also . 

<root> Do you remember ? 

<root> I sure do , I sure do . 

<root> What are the startup costs involved ? 

<root> It varies ; look around Manhattan , look around rents , look around build-outs , look around hiring , look around advertising ... 

<root> What 's your greatest non-fixed cost ? 

<root> The single most costly thing we spend on is rent and advertising , those two together make up the bulk of what we spend . 

<root> There 's supplies , and there 's wear and tear and maintenance , and bookkeeping and things like that that you have to do . 

<root> That 's about it . 

<root> The hardest thing in running this business , which is why people ca n't do it , is the relationship that my wife has with the gals and with the customers . 

<root> Where do you advertise ? 

<root> A lot on the web , we 've used most of the local city papers , New York Press , things like that , L Magazine . 

<root> In the back of the paper ? 

<root> Typically in the back of the paper . 

<root> Magazines constantly change their policy on it ; they want it , they do n't want it ... 

<root> Depending on the election year -- 

<root> Who 's buying the paper , who 's selling the paper . 

<root> So it changes , so one year we got to be in the Press , but they have now stopped adult ads . 

<root> Completely . 

<root> So now we 'll be in the Voice for a while . 

<root> We 're moving more towards the Internet at this point , because the Internet is a much easier , safer way for a person to look at sensitive material and not get caught with it . 

<root> Hiring employees 

<root> Personality test questions given to prospective mistresses . 

<root> Pursuant to your business question : we only hire nice people . 

<root> I do n't care if a girl is absolutely exquisite looking -- 

<root> My husband has met beautiful , beautiful girls -- 

<root> -- beautiful girls -- 

<root> -- and he 's in the end , he would say , " Well , I wo n't hire them . " 

<root> I 'm like , ‘ Are you insane ? 

<root> I wo n't hire them . I hire -- 

<root> Why not ? 

<root> Because I want someone who 's going to treat people nicely and well . 

<root> We have -- 

<root> How can you tell whether they will or will not ? 

<root> Just by talking to them ? 

<root> Having been a psychologist for a number of years gives me a leg up on it . 

<root> And he 's been right . 

<root> And I have made him hire these girls , and ultimately he 's been right 

<root> They 've been complete pain in the asses ! 

<root> I also have a profile they fill out for me , a mini-MMPI that I developed , so that I have an idea -- Rebecca and I put it together 

<root> I do n't know if you 'd like to see one . 

<root> No , no , no . Just -- 

<root> I could show you . 

<root> So I have a mini-MMPI that I -- 

<root> Could I have a sample , not necessarily one that 's filled out , but just one that you -- 

<root> I 'll show you . 

<root> The questions are -- 

<root> Be careful . 

<root> He 'll make you fill one out . 

<root> You 'd be scared . 

<root> You would n't hire me . 

<root> Is it only girls you hire ? 

<root> Yeah . 

<root> What would a question like " the greatest woman in the world " reveal to you ? 

<root> No question would reveal anything independently of all the questions together -- 

<root> Sure . 

<root> -- but I have a chart that I 'll go through ; the MMPI . 

<root> The baseline data that I use to -- 

<root> How did you originate these questions ? 

<root> Where did I make them ? 

<root> You get a baseline from asking girls and refining profiles -- 

<root> And it 's an amalgamation of questions . 

<root> Of many , many questions -- 

<root> What 's your favorite question ? 

<root> I do n't know , the O.J. Simpson …. 

<root> Yeah , I see O.J. Simpson . 

<root> What would that be an indicator of ? 

<root> I 'm not sure which one you gave him , but there 's a brief , brief , brief IQ test there . 

<root> Very brief . 

<root> Do you ask for references ? 

<root> No , because I really ca n't call and tell them I 'm yeah , so-and-so 's applying here for a position . 

<root> Jack Herrick , wikiHow founder interviewed by Wikinews 

<root> Saturday , January 31 , 2009 

<root> Herrick at RecentChangesCamp 2008 Image : ShakataGaNai . 

<root> wikiHow is a wiki-based site which aims to " build the world 's largest , highest quality how-to manual . " 

<root> It recently published its 50,000th article , and to discuss what the site has achieved since its creation , Wikinews interviewed the site 's founder , Jack Herrick . 

<root> In the interview , Herrick explains what wikiHow is , why he decided to create it , how he grew it in size , and why he chose to use a Creative Commons license ( HyperLink ) for his site . 

<root> Read below for more of the interview in full . 

<root> Interview 

<root> For our readers who are unaware of your site , could you briefly explain what wikiHow is ? 

<root> Sure . 

<root> wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world 's largest , highest quality how-to manual . 

<root> Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language . 

<root> We 're quite far from our goals currently , but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger 

<root> We currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles . 

<root> We hope that in time , we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status . 

<root> That said , we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve . 

<root> However , in terms of readership , we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia . 

<root> We get over 14 million unique visitors per month ( source : Google Analytics ) , which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast . 

<root> [ Note : The interview took place just before the 50000 milestone was met ] 

<root> Like Wikipedia , wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software . 

<root> Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world . 

<root> That said , we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects : 

<root> We are much smaller . 

<root> The English wikiHow has only 60 admins , compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia . 

<root> As a result , wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors . 

<root> We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good . 

<root> This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation . 

<root> We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations . 

<root> Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons . 

<root> ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity ) . 

<root> In addition , we 've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral . 

<root> ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral ) 

<root> Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility . 

<root> As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online . 

<root> Why did you decide to create wikiHow ? 

<root> I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person . 

<root> Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine . 

<root> How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity ? 

<root> I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world . 

<root> Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful . 

<root> I 've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow . 

<root> My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow . 

<root> eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world . 

<root> eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software . 

<root> When I ran eHow , the content was professionally produced and edited . 

<root> This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets . 

<root> However , paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices . 

<root> You either 1 ) sacrifice on breadth and do n't produce the topics that wo n't interest advertisers , or 2 ) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that does n't cost much to write . 

<root> I was n't interested in making either of these sacrifices , as I think the world 's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive . 

<root> So ultimately I decided that eHow 's model would not build the resource I envisioned . 

<root> When I discovered Wikipedia , I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs . 

<root> So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow . 

<root> Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license ? 

<root> We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork ) . 

<root> In my opinion , people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the " right to leave . " 

<root> If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction , they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere . 

<root> This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license . 

<root> This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community . 

<root> I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far . 

<root> My hope is that over time , internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others . 

<root> That said , when we started out I did n't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver 's license . 

<root> As a result , we made some mistakes along the path . 

<root> In retrospect , I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC . 

<root> At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects . 

<root> wikiHow now has millions of visitors per month . 

<root> How did you grow the site to the size it is today ? 

<root> In December 2008 , wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics ( Full data : http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics ) . 

<root> Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US . 

<root> ( http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com ) . 

<root> wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons . 

<root> First , people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information . 

<root> People want to learn more practical skills , and for the most part the internet does n't provide enough quality information yet . 

<root> Second , we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing : We had some articles of mixed quality , and editors joined to improve those articles , which in turn attracted more readers . 

<root> We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle : More readers , means more editors , which creates better instructions , leading again to more readers . 

<root> It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed . 

<root> Wikinews interviews academic Simon Ličen about attitudes towards US Paralympics 

<root> Saturday , November 16 , 2013 

<root> A Russian stamp for Paralympic Games in Sochi in 2014 

<root> On Thursday , with 110 days until the start of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi , Russia , Wikinews interviewed Assistant Professor in Educational Leadership , Sport Studies and Educational / Counseling Psychology at Washington State University Simon Ličen about attitudes in United States towards the Paralympics . 

<root> Ličen has recently joined the Sport Management Program at Washington State University to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents . 

<root> Originally from Slovenia , he served as the Director of Media and Communications of a WTA Tour event and was a member of the UNESCO Slovenian National Commission . 

<root> He was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian wheelchair basketball national team . 

<root> Why do you think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like Australia , the United Kingdom and even Canada ? 

<root> Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society . 

<root> It emphasizes consumerism , the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities , dedication and qualifications , and reinforces , rather than changes , existing ideas related to gender , ethnicity and nationality . 

<root> Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled . 

<root> Although disability is not contagious , interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it . 

<root> Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication , hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to . 

<root> Other countries , including the ones you mention , have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society . 

<root> Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act , many social institutions including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity . 

<root> What do you think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time ? 

<root> The impact depends on a number of aspects . 

<root> One of them is the channels that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on . 

<root> Will they be shown nationally or regionally , on NBC or on any of the company ’s multiple cable networks ? 

<root> A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown . 

<root> Remember that there is a nine-hour difference between Sochi and New York , and a 12-hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast . 

<root> So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night , and evening prime-time events will be shown — indeed live — in the morning U.S. time . 

<root> So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous than it appears . 

<root> A third important factor is the way the event will be mediated : will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics ? 

<root> Will they treat and announce the competitions as they do all others — for better and worse ? 

<root> Will they take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity ? 

<root> All in all , I think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects ; but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations . 

<root> Friday , January 3 , 2014 

<root> Preston , Victoria , Australia 

<root> On Saturday , Wikinews interviewed Tina McKenzie , a former member of the Australia women 's national wheelchair basketball team , known as the Gliders . 

<root> McKenzie , a silver and bronze Paralympic medalist in wheelchair basketball , retired from the game after the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London . 

<root> Wikinews caught up with her in a cafe in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Preston . 

<root> [ The Spitfire Tournament in Canada ] was a really good tournament actually . 

<root> It was a tournament that I wish we 'd actually gone back to more often . 

<root> Who plays in that one ? 

<root> It 's quite a large Canadian tournament , and so we went as the Gliders team . 

<root> So we were trying to get as many international games as possible . 

<root> Cause that 's one of our problems really , to compete . 

<root> It costs us so much money to for us to travel overseas and to compete internationally . 

<root> And so we can compete against each other all the time within Australia but we really need to be able to ... 

<root> It 's not the same . 

<root> No , it 's really not , so it 's really important to be able to get as a many international trips throughout the year to continue our improvement . 

<root> Also see where all the other teams are at as well . 

<root> But yes , Spitfire was good . 

<root> We took quite a few new girls over there back then in 2005 , leading into the World Cup in the Netherlands . 

<root> Was that the one where you were the captain of the team , in 2005 ? 

<root> Or was that a later one ? 

<root> No , I captained in 2010 . 

<root> So 2009 , 2010 World Cup . 

<root> And then I had a bit of some time off in 2011 . 

<root> The Gliders have never won the World Championship . 

<root> We always seem to have just a little bit of a chill out at the World Cup . 

<root> I do n't know why . 

<root> It 's really strange occurrence , over the years . 

<root> 2002 World Cup , we won bronze . 

<root> Then in 2006 we ended up fourth . 

<root> It was one of the worst World Cups we 've played actually . 

<root> And then in 2010 we just ... I do n't know what happened . 

<root> We just did n't play as well as we thought we would . 

<root> Came fourth . 

<root> But you know what ? 

<root> Fired us up for the actual Paralympics . 

<root> So the World Cup is ... it 's good to be able to do well at the World Cup , to be placed , but it also means that you get a really good opportunity to know where you 're at in that two year gap between the Paralympics . 

<root> So you can come back home and revisit what you need to do and , you know , where the team 's at . 

<root> And all that sort of stuff . 

<root> Unfortunately , they are talking about moving it so it will be on the year before the Paralympics . 

<root> Oh really . 

<root> The competition from the [ FIFA ] World Cup and all . 

<root> Right . 

<root> Well , that would be sad .

<root> Frank Messina : An Interview with the ' Mets Poet ' 

<root> Wednesday , October 3 , 2007 

<root> You have received a good deal of attention recently . 

<root> Even though I m not Michael Jackson or somebody , when people come up to me and introduce themselves and say , ' Hey Frank , my name is John , ' I say , ' Hey John , my name is Frank ' and they laugh . 

<root> It 's a funny phenomenon . 

<root> What goes through your head when that happens ? 

<root> I understand it . 

<root> I 've gone to readings and concerts . 

<root> I look at it as human interaction . 

<root> Over the years I have performed in 32 countries and 40 states . 

<root> I 've been doing this professionally since I was in my twenties , and before that since I was sixteen doing little tidbit poetry readings in coffeehouses . 

<root> The band I started in 1993 , Spoken Motion , received a lot of recognition as a spoken word band born out of the New York spoken word scene . 

<root> I worked with some great musicians and performed around the world . 

<root> I remember signing my first autograph to a kid when I was 25 years old . 

<root> As time went on , I came out with books and CDs , and I became used to that kind of thing . 

<root> To me , the ultimate feeling of success as an artist , is to move somebody enough where they thank you . 

<root> When someone comes up and says , ' Frank , thank you , your work is great . " 

<root> You have a long career in poetry , but as of late the attention you have garnered is for the Mets-inspired work . 

<root> How do you feel about having a lot of your work overshadowed by the Mets work ? 

<root> It 's ironic . 

<root> Some of the greatest poetry has been born out of failure and the depths of adversity in the human experience . 

<root> Walt Whitman , the first great American poet , wrote about the Civil War . 

<root> He went looking for his brother , George Whitman , after he a telegram telling him his brother was injured in the South . 

<root> When he started out his poems were about beating drums , and blow , bugle , blow . 

<root> Real patriotic . 

<root> Then he started to see the real horrors of war . 

<root> He was able to tap into the human condition and the situation at that time . 

<root> Eventually when he found his brother he had resolution . 

<root> I experienced that kind of adversity during 9/11 being a civilian volunteer . 

<root> I loaded ferry boats in Jersey City across the river to deliver goods to Ground Zero . 

<root> I turned to Whitman to find some understanding of what is happening in the world right now . 

<root> When I wrote my 9/11-related poems , that was true adversity . 

<root> I realize baseball is just a game . 

<root> Can you recite a stanza that expresses how you feel right now ? 

<root> This was a piece that the Times only quoted one stanza , but it 's about preparation for a battle , and being prepared to either rise to the occasion , or go down : 

<root> Do you know what it 's like to be chased by the Ghost of Failure while staring through Victory 's door ? 

<root> Of course you do , you 're a Mets fan caught in a do-or-die moment in late September at Shea 

<root> As one that s battled hard through many a broken dream Let me say , " in order to rise to the occasion you must be willing to go down with the ship " , 

<root> Have no fear , no hesitation , for Winning shall be it's reward ! 

<root> Do n't let them get in your head ! 

<root> you 've kept it up this long 

<root> You 're a Mets fan in late September and you ll fight til the glorious end 

<root> Cheer the team today ; ( your boys in orange and blue ) Let them hear you shout as they fight for what 's mightily due 

<root> ( copyright Frank Messina ; reprinted with permission ) " 

<root> Sports fans are n't known as patrons of poetry . 

<root> Have you had interaction with " new readers ' through your Mets work ? 

<root> This one person who I never met took a picture of me and sent it to me in an e-mail . 

<root> The e-mail said , ' Frank , I have never bothered you during the game , but I just wanted to say thank you for your work and thank you for making some sense of the successes and failures and I wish you much success with your work . ' 

<root> Last year in my section at the stadium I had a banner that read We Know ' . 

<root> That 's all it said . 

<root> Then earlier this year these shirts started to come out that said , " Poet says We Know " . 

<root> It was amazing . 

<root> We did n't use the banner this year , though , because we did n't know . 

<root> The team was n't so far ahead that we knew . 

<root> Last year we just knew we were going to the playoffs ; we knew we were going post-season . 

<root> This year we were n't sure . 

<root> We were walking on eggshells . 

<root> There was a woman , a season ticket holder and a die hard fan . 

<root> She was staggered by the loss last year to the Cardinals . 

<root> Last year she came up to me during one of the games late in the season ; she was so happy we were going to the post season . 

<root> By that point we had clinched it . 

<root> She handed me a shirt she bought at the stadium and she gave me a big hug . 

<root> With tears in her eyes she said , " Thank you , Mets Poet , thank you . " 

<root> It 's cool ... it 's like another family . 

<root> Moments like that must make you realize you have touched people who are n't normally touched by poetry . 

<root> It 's opened up a new fan base , so to speak . 

<root> For the last year SNY has broadcast footage of me with my poems , so quite a few fans known about the " Mets Poet ' . 

<root> I have never called myself that , by the way . 

<root> The back of my jersey says " The Poet ' because growing up that was my nickname . 

<root> My brother was a runner and they used to call him The Birdman -- Birdie -- and they called me The Poet . 

<root> It was a natural thing , but I never coined myself as ' The Mets Poet . ' 

<root> The Onion : An interview with ' America 's Finest News Source ' 

<root> Sunday , November 25 , 2007 

<root> How The Onion writes an issue 

<root> This exclusive interview features first-hand journalism by a Wikinews reporter . 

<root> See the collaboration page for more details . 

<root> How do you decide on the stories ? 

<root> We do everything backwards here . 

<root> We start with the headline and then flesh out the story , as opposed to The New York Times , which writes the issue and then has a headline editor to make it snappy . 

<root> We start with a joke . 

<root> We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside — a contributing core . 

<root> We whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred , come in Tuesday and pick an issue and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff ; all fifteen of us . 

<root> Then we assign a headline to a specific writer to execute . 

<root> We go through a number of drafts and then have the editors pick it up and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team , who adds the visual aspect to it . 

<root> The editors punch it up over the last couple of days and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition . 

<root> So you do n’t have writers coming up with a story and headline , but you will instead have a team of writers choosing the best headlines and then assign it to a particular writer who was not necessarily involved ? 

<root> Writers will occasionally write their own headlines , but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas , what we think will make a good story and then we assign it based upon what people ’s writing strengths are . 

<root> We have some people who are great at politics ; some people we give all the war stuff to ; someone who is in charge of the Britney Spears story of the week — the entertainment stories . 

<root> The headlines 

<root> Editorial Manager Chet Clem and President Sean Mills . 

<root> Image : David Shankbone 

<root> It seems like some publications , like AM New York , always have a Britney Spears story ; 

<root> is there anything similar with The Onion where they continually revisit a topic or person ? 

<root> No , not necessarily . 

<root> We are a little less reactionary . 

<root> We tend to target the zeitgeist more than anything . 

<root> We ’ll hit the mainstream media ’s portrayal of the entertainment world as much as we ’ll hit characters in the entertainment world . 

<root> We ’ll attack People Magazine ’s coverage of Britney as much as Britney . 

<root> In an interview with Terry Gross , Stephen Colbert said of his time at Second City that they had decided on not doing political humor and , in particular , hackneyed political humor such as Ted Kennedy drinking jokes . 

<root> They felt it was overdone , mean-spirited and not funny . 

<root> Do your writers have similar rules of thumb ? 

<root> We do n’t have any rules or known lines we wo n’t cross . 

<root> We have an understanding based upon having the same writers in the back room for years , and those writers training the new writers as they come in . 

<root> There is an understanding in the room . 

<root> If it makes the room laugh , it probably ends up in the paper . 

<root> One example is we ran an article a couple of years back that was , " No Jennifer Lopez News Today " . 

<root> That was our reaction to all of the J-Lo stuff . 

<root> We were n’t going to touch on her dress , or who she was dating . 

<root> Just the fact that those were the lead stories for so many days , in everything from US Weekly to Time Magazine . 

<root> I think it ’s important we have an original take on those things . 

<root> I think it ’s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross . 

<root> We do n’t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle . 

<root> There ’s a 24 hour comedy news cycle that exists on all the late night talk shows . 

<root> The Onion has a different creative process where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes . 

<root> We want an original take . 

<root> If we choose to do something on J-Lo , it ’s going to be something like that , something less obvious . 

<root> When you are going through the headlines , is it just you guys sitting around trying to crack each other up ? 

<root> It ’s the least amount of fun possible . 

<root> Nah , I ’m kidding . 

<root> It ’s actually more businesslike than you ’d imagine . 

<root> It ’s very much like you are trying to make the room laugh , but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now , so it takes a lot to make the room laugh . 

<root> The best analogy I ’ve heard is when Rob Siegel , former editor-in-chief , likened it to wine tasting . 

<root> It ’s this quiet experience where you are trying to soak in what the joke is , have we done anything like this , is it a unique take , what are other people doing . 

<root> It ’s sort of like , " Hmmm ... that ’s hilarious . That ’s really really funny " rather than people falling off their chairs . 

<root> It ’s more subdued than I think what most people would expect . 

<root> It ’s more analytical and clinical ? 

<root> Not all the time , but it ca n’t be a laugh a minute . 

<root> Yeah , what you see on Studio 60 and 30 Rock , those are scripted writers rooms . 

<root> Everything is funny there . 

<root> There 's a lot of unfunny jokes that are told in a back room , that 's why they stay and die in that back room and do n’t go out in The Onion . 

<root> If someone is continually telling unfunny jokes , do you eventually fire them ? 

<root> That ’s why we are on the 10th floor to make sure they die when they get kicked out . 

<root> It can be a real mess on Broadway . 

<root> By the time you get to be a writer for The Onion , though , the odds are you are going to succeed because we make it pretty challenging . 

<root> You go through quite a bit . 

<root> You will already have demonstrated a pretty long successful record of writing stuff for us before you will be in that room on a daily basis . 

<root> But if somebody wakes up one morning and suddenly no longer is funny , then yeah , head first , out the door as quickly as possible , and as sadistically as possible . 

<root> Wikinews interviews Israeli mathematician and writer Aner Shalev 

<root> Wednesday , September 19 , 2007 

<root> Aner Shalev is an Israeli mathematician and writer born in 1958 in Kibbutz Kinneret , Tiberias . 

<root> Currently Shalev is a Professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem 's Einstein Institute of Mathematics . 

<root> At the moment Shalev is in Levico Terme , Trento , Italy for a conference . 

<root> He was interviewed by Wikinews . 

<root> Interview 

<root> Aner Shalev 

<root> What are you going to talk about here in Levico ? 

<root> I called it Character , walks and words . 

<root> There is a whole topic which is called asymptotic groups theory . 

<root> There are groups which express the symmetry of some structures . 

<root> Studying groups is a bit like studying symmetry . 

<root> It 's very beautiful I think . 

<root> And then when you do it in an asymptotic way is like you do n't look at the small details . 

<root> It 's like from the sky . 

<root> You look at the general patterns . 

<root> And there is another topic which is very important in mathematics which is called representation theory . 

<root> So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory to solve all kind of problems and conjectures in asymptotic groups theory . 

<root> Why did you choose to study mathematics ? 

<root> First of all because it was beautiful . 

<root> When I was ten my father already showed me some stuff in mathematics and the beauty and the imagination was quite apparent . 

<root> I also like the freedom in mathematics . 

<root> If you study physics or chemistry then you should describe the real world . 

<root> But in mathematics you can build your own structures . 

<root> You can walk in worlds created by the imagination of people . 

<root> You 're not committed to the real world . 

<root> It 's almost like God to some extent . 

<root> You can create worlds , you can study them . 

<root> I think it 's a combination of the beauty , of the imagination , of the freedom . 

<root> Many people , and many students , dislike math . 

<root> Why do you think it is so ? 

<root> First of all I think maybe they have bad teachers , which is a problem . 

<root> You have to have very good teachers in mathematics if you really want to enjoy and to succeed in it . 

<root> Probably some people mainly think about the scientific part of it – you have to be accurate - and they see less these elements of the freedom , and the imagination , and creation . 

<root> Maybe they do n't like the precise nature of mathematics . 

<root> Also when I talk mathematics I notice the language is very important in mathematics and I actually notice that many times people fail in mathematics because they do n't know how to write a composition . 

<root> They have ideas but they can not formulate them in the right way . 

<root> Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature because almost all the thing I told about mathematics are also seen in literature and in writing because when you write you can describe the real world , but you can also create worlds of fiction . 

<root> So you have imagination , you have total freedom , you can invent characters , you can invent all kind of development and surprises and this kind of end of story or another . 

<root> Also the language is important in writing and in literature . 

<root> So in a way people often do n't know how to combine the two fields . 

<root> It could look like almost the opposite : literature is kind of arts and mathematics is science but they also see a lot in common and there where mathematician who were writers . 

<root> For example the most famous is Lewis Carrol , author of Alice in Wonderland . 

<root> You 're not only a mathematician . 

<root> You also wrote two collections of short stories and a novel . 

<root> Why did you begin to write ? 

<root> When I was quite young I was interested in psychoanalysis and in dreams . 

<root> I was trying to interpret my dreams . 

<root> I started to write down my dreams . 

<root> And then I noticed that I cheat a little bit when I write them down . 

<root> Sometimes I make them more pretty then they were actually . 

<root> So instead of documenting the dreams it gradually became also like adding creational elements , and I think that somehow through writing my dreams I gradually came to writing , also poems , but mainly stories . 

<root> I 'm a little bit inspired by dreams but when eventually I started to write more seriously I was more interested in structure which also .. a bit like mathematics in a way .. for example my first book is called Opus 1 .. a collection of four long stories with musical structures . 

<root> The first part is called Legato and the second part was called Staccato . 

<root> In the legato part the sentences are very long and without breaks almost like stream of consciousness . 

<root> In the staccato part it 's like a music : a lot of break , very very short sentences . 

<root> It was a bit experimenting connections between the language and the music and the psychology of people . 

<root> In the second book I made another experiment . 

<root> It 's a book of opening , Overtures I called it , and there is no end to the stories . 

<root> There are seventy beginning of stories without ends . 

<root> In the novel Dark Matters I think what interested me in the structure was two thing : simple narrative and email . 

<root> It keeps changing between narrative and email . 

<root> Another thing was two different time scapes : one goes very slow and one goes very fast and they almost kind of meet in the end . 

<root> It 's a little bit like Achilles and the turtle . 

<root> ... love story and romance and surprises and tragedies and all this but also this structure interested me a lot . 

<root> Why did you choose this particular structure ? 

<root> When I tell stories I do n't like that everything will be clear from the beginning . 

<root> I like that something will be a bit of secret , or even unreliable narrator : someone tells something and first you trust him but then you read more and you become thrilled by everything . 

<root> I think by using emails on the one hand which are more the voice of the woman Eva and narrative which is more the perspective of the man Adam , I kind of confront them , their different perspective and then kind somehow you can see the distortions in the way the story is told . 

<root> I think that in this kind of structure there is a very gradual clarification of the relationship and the forth going on . 

<root> Keep your eyes peeled for cosmic debris : Andrew Westphal about Stardust @ home 

<root> Sunday , May 28 , 2006 

<root> Stardust is a NASA space capsule that collected samples from comet 81P/Wild ( also known as " Wild 2 ) in deep space and landed back on Earth on January 15 , 2006 . 

<root> It was decided that a collaborative online review process would be used to " discover " the microscopically small samples the capsule collected . 

<root> The project is called Stardust @ home . 

<root> Unlike distributed computing projects like SETI @ home , Stardust @ home relies entirely on human intelligence . 

<root> Andrew Westphal is the director of Stardust @ home . 

<root> Wikinews interviewed him for May 's Interview of the Month ( IOTM ) on May 18 , 2006 . 

<root> As always , the interview was conducted on IRC , with multiple people asking questions . 

<root> Some may not know exactly what Stardust or Stardust @ home is . 

<root> Can you explain more about it for us ? 

<root> Artist 's rendering of Spacecraft Stardust 

<root> Image : NASA 

<root> Stardust is a NASA Discovery mission that was launched in 1999 . 

<root> It is really two missions in one . 

<root> The primary science goal of the mission was to collect a sample from a known primitive solar-system body , a comet called Wild 2 ( pronounced " Vilt-two " — the discoverer was German , I believe ) . 

<root> This is the first US " sample return " mission since Apollo , and the first ever from beyond the moon . 

<root> This gives a little context . 

<root> By " sample return " of course I mean a mission that brings back extraterrestrial material . 

<root> I should have said above that this is the first " solid " sample return mission — 

<root> Genesis brought back a sample from the Sun almost two years ago , but Stardust is also bringing back the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium — 

<root> basically this is a sample of the Galaxy . 

<root> This is absolutely unprecedented , and we 're obviously incredibly excited . 

<root> I should mention parenthetically that there is a fantastic launch video — taken from the POV of the rocket on the JPL Stardust website — highly recommended — best I 've ever seen — all the way from the launch pad , too . 

<root> Basically interplanetary trajectory . 

<root> Absolutely great . 

<root> Is the video available to the public ? 

<root> Yes [ see below ] . 

<root> OK , I digress . 

<root> The first challenge that we have before can do any kind of analysis of these interstellar dust particles is simply to find them . 

<root> This is a big challenge because they are very small ( order of micron in size ) and are somewhere ( we do n't know where ) on a HUGE collector — at least on the scale of the particle size — about a tenth of a square meter . 

<root> So ... 

<root> We 're right now using an automated microscope that we developed several years ago for nuclear astrophysics work to scan the collector in the Cosmic Dust Lab in Building 31 at Johnson Space Center . 

<root> This is the ARES group that handles returned samples ( Moon Rocks , Genesis chips , Meteorites , and Interplanetary Dust Particles collected by U2 in the stratosphere ) . 

<root> The microscope collects stacks of digital images of the aerogel collectors in the array . 

<root> These images are sent to us — we compress them and convert them into a format appropriate for Stardust @ home . 

<root> Stardust @ home is a highly distributed project using a " Virtual Microscope " that is written in html and javascript and runs on most browsers — no downloads are required . 

<root> Using the Virtual Microscope volunteers can search over the collector for the tracks of the interstellar dust particles . 

<root> Aerogel slice removed with an ultrasonic blade , showing particle tracks . 

<root> Image : NASA 

<root> How many samples do you anticipate being found during the course of the project ? 

<root> Great question . 

<root> The short answer is that we do n't know . 

<root> The long answer is a bit more complicated . 

<root> Here 's what we know . 

<root> The Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft carried dust detectors onboard that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used to first detect and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles streaming into the solar system . 

<root> ( This is a kind of " wind " of interstellar dust , caused by the fact that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium . ) 

<root> Markus Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the " cruise " phase of the interplanetary orbit in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind . 

<root> He estimated that there should be around 45 particles , but this number is very uncertain — I would n't be surprised if it is quite different from that . 

<root> That was the long answer ! 

<root> One thing that I should say ... is that like all research , the outcome of what we are doing is highly uncertain . 

<root> There is a wonderful quote attributed to Einstein — " If we knew what we were doing , it would n't be called " research " , would it ? " 

<root> How big would the samples be ? 

<root> We expect that the particles will be of order a micron in size . 

<root> ( A millionth of a meter . ) 

<root> When people are searching using the virtual microscope , they will be looking not for the particles , but for the tracks that the particles make , which are much larger — several microns in diameter . 

<root> Just yesterday we switched over to a new site which has a demo of the VM ( virtual microscope ) I invite you to check it out . 

<root> The tracks in the demo are from submicron carbonyl iron particles that were shot into aerogel using a particle accelerator modified to accelerate dust particles to very high speeds , to simulate the interstellar dust impacts that we 're looking for . 

<root> And that 's on the main Stardust @ home website [ see below ] ? 

<root> Yes . 

<root> Over 900 asylum seekers rescued off Indonesian coast 

<root> Monday , May 18 , 2015 

<root> On Friday , fishermen rescued over 700 asylum seekers whose boat sank , and the Indonesian Navy reportedly saved 200 more after they were found swimming along the coast of Aceh , Indonesia . 

<root> Major general Fuad Basya , spokesman for the Indonesian military , said fisherman first noticed the people and a warship was deployed to retrieve them . 

<root> The rescued members included Bangladeshis and Rohingya , a stateless minority of Muslims from Myanmar . 

<root> Myanmar is mainly Buddhist and the United Nations rates the Rohingya among the world 's most persecuted groups . 

<root> According to ABC News , Basya also believes the asylum seekers found in the water may have left the boat on purpose to be rescued to avoid being sent away from Indonesia waters . 

<root> Malaysia and Indonesia have maintained a policy of turning away boats of migrants which , according to AFP , the Untied Nations and United States have both criticised . 

<root> One Rohingya , Muhammad Amin , the first boat rescued on Friday was turned around twice , toward Malaysia by Indonesian navy and then toward Indonesia by Malaysian navy . 

<root> Discussing his concern in a public statement , Malaysia 's Prime Minister , Najib Razak said , " We are in contact with all relevant parties , with whom we share the desire to find a solution to this crisis " . 

<root> Thailand has recently cracked down on human trafficking , which has affected the routes by which people-smugglers transport migrants . 

<root> The US State Department said John Kerry , the Secretary of State , contacted Thailand 's foreign minister over temporary housing for the Rohingya out at sea . 

<root> Jeff Rathke , the State Department Spokesperson , said , " We urge the governments of the region to work together quickly , first and foremost , to save the lives of migrants now at sea who are in need of an immediate rescue effort " . 

<root> Rathke also asked the governments of South East Asia not to turn away boats of people seeking asylum . 

<root> Estimates suggest 8000 migrants may be currently at sea in the region . 

<root> Texas student Ahmed Mohamed inspires social movement 

<root> Tuesday , September 22 , 2015 

<root> News of police response to a boy 's digital clock in Texas last week has inspired a global social movement in support of the youth . 

<root> Ahmed Mohamed , a 14-year-old boy from Irving , Texas , was arrested at his school by police after he brought a digital clock he had made to school . 

<root> After news of the police response was reported , Mohamed received support online ranging from US President Barack Obama to Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg . 

<root> Yesterday Mohamed received VIP attention at Google headquarters in California at the Google Science Fair — and tomorrow he plans to meet international dignitaries at the United Nations headquarters in New York . 

<root> US President Barack Obama tweet to student Ahmed Mohamed 

<root> Image : Twitter / Barack Obama . 

<root> Mohamed brought the digital clock he made to school on September 14 , and a teacher mistakenly thought it resembled a bomb . 

<root> Police arrested and questioned the student . 

<root> Images of the boy wearing a NASA T-shirt and handcuffed by the police were quickly posted and reposted online . 

<root> The Deseret News observed that the hashtag on Twitter , #IStandWithAhmed , had become an international phenomenon . 

<root> The Straits Times noted what began as individual messages to Mohamed had grown into a " support movement " . 

<root> American academic and professor Marc Lamont Hill commented , 

<root> " Hoping that the #istandwithahmed movement translates into a substantive national conversation on race , punishment , and incarceration . " 

<root> The Twitter attention led to outreach from Google and Mohamed was invited to their Google Science Fair . 

<root> Mohamed was a VIP guest at the Google Science Fair this weekend , and was able to meet finalists at the event held at Google 's headquarters located in Mountain View , California . 

<root> Co-founder of Google , Sergey Brin , personally met with Mohamed during his visit to Google . 

<root> On Wednesday , Mohamed and his father are to travel to the United Nations . 

<root> His father Mohamed El-Hassan Mohamed said he was taking his entire family to the U.N. headquarters in New York , because international dignitaries wanted to meet with his son and express their support . 

<root> Psychology major at University of Texas Arlington Amneh Jafari heard of the incident and wanted to issue her support to Mohamed . 

<root> She chose the hastag #IStandWithAhmed and posted to Twitter . 

<root> Jafari said she felt Mohamed had been subject to Islamophobia and her hashtag created greater awareness about this issue . 

<root> The hashtag took on a life of its own , and was used in messages on Twitter over one million times by Thursday night . 

<root> NASA tweeted support of Ahmed Mohamed via its account International Space Station 

<root> Image : Twitter / NASA . 

<root> US President Barack Obama tweeted using his @POTUS account : 

<root> " Cool clock , Ahmed . 

<root> Want to bring it to the White House ? 

<root> We should inspire more kids like you to like science . 

<root> It 's what makes America great . " 

<root> Twitter gave Mohamed the option to come to their company for an internship . 

<root> Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg tweeted to Mohamed and said the boy was welcome to come and tour the company . 

<root> Executive director of the Dallas chapter of the Council on American - Islamic Relations Alia Salem said Mohamed wishes to use his newfound fame and attention to spotlight social causes including the treatment of Muslims in the United States . 

<root> University of Texas Arlington Muslim Student Association president Sehar Memon said the large amount of positive feedback for Mohamed had helped make his situation much better . 

<root> Memon also said she believed the social movement in reaction to Mohamed helped improve Muslim / non-Muslim . 

<root> Both the Irving Independent School District and the Irving Police Department have asserted that the boy 's religion and name were not a factor in the manner in which they approached the situation . 

<root> At least 107 killed in Mecca crane collapse 

<root> Saturday , September 12 , 2015 

<root> pilgrims at Mecca 's Grand Mosque in 2008 . 

<root> A storm yesterday caused a crane to fall into Mecca 's Grand Mosque , killing 107 or more and wounding 238 , according to Saudi Arabia 's Civil Defense Authority . 

<root> Civil Defense Authority director General Suleiman al-Amr , in remarks to al-Ikhbariya television , said " All those who were wounded and the dead have been taken to hospital . There are no casualties left at the location . " 

<root> The accident , which occurred yesterday afternoon , was caused by strong winds and heavy rain that led the crane to fall . 

<root> Photos released of the scene showed numerous bloodied bodies and various scattered debris . 

<root> The accident occurred at a time when the mosque was relatively uncrowded . 

<root> " Had it happened an hour later it would have been much worse , " Khaled Al-Maeena , editor at large at the Saudi Gazette , said . 

<root> " Had it happened five hours earlier or four hours earlier , I think the death toll would have been more than a thousand . " 

<root> The crane accident comes just ten days before the beginning of the Hajj , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca , Islam 's holiest site . 

<root> As undergoing a pilgrimage to Mecca is a mandatory religious duty for all Muslims who physically and financially can , millions of pilgrims arrive in Mecca each year for the Hajj . 

<root> Construction was underway at the mosque in order to enlarge the mosque and improve crowd control , which has been a recurring problem during Mecca 's pilgrimages . 

<root> New faces emerge as veteran politicians step down in Hong Kong legislative election 

<root> Friday , September 9 , 2016 

<root> The Hong Kong legislative election was held on Sunday , with a record-breaking turnout of around 2 million voters and turnout rate of 58 % . 

<root> The results show the anti-establishment camp successfully maintained a majority in the geographical constituencies ' seats thus veto power to any members ' bills , and also a minority larger than a third to veto any bills featuring major political reforms . 

<root> Young and new faces emerged in the new council members , as veteran politicians stepped down in both the anti-establishment and pro-Beijing campus .

<root> DAB 's Starry Lee ; from file , 2015 . 

<root> In traditional functional constituencies , the pan-democracy camp gained a seat from the pro-Beijing camp . 

<root> Shiu Ka-chun of the Social Welfare constituency defeated their opponents , hence the pan-democrats ' seats in the functional constituencies increased from 9 to 10 . 

<root> Also , an independent who does not claim to belong to either camp , Edward Yiu of the Architectural , Surveying , Planning and Landscape constituency , defeated his opponents and was elected . 

<root> The turnout of this election was the highest in the history of Legislative Council elections , with around 2 million voters voted and a turnout rate of 58 % . 

<root> At a polling station in Taikoo of the Hong Kong Island constituency , after the polls closed at 22:30 , with the long queues outside the station the last ballot there was cast at 2:30 the next day , four hours after the last person was allowed to join the queue . 

<root> The previous general legislative election in Hong Kong was before the 2014 protests . 

<root> The election elects 70 members of the Legislative Council . 

<root> New Zealand begins process to consider changing national flag design 

<root> Thursday , May 7 , 2015 

<root> On Tuesday , the New Zealand government announced the start of a public process to suggest designs for a new national flag , and determine whether their citizens would prefer a different national flag over the current one . 

<root> The current flag of New Zealand . 

<root> The current New Zealand flag is partially based on the United Kingdom 's flag ; 

<root> the new one would be unique to New Zealand . 

<root> The government 's Flag Consideration Project has planned a number of conferences and roadshows as part of this process , with the first meeting set to take place in Christchurch on May 16 . 

<root> According to the New Zealand Herald , Emeritus Professor John Burrows , the chairman of the project 's panel of twelve , said New Zealand 's flag has never before been open to public choice . 

<root> Professor Burrows also said resources and kits would be accessible for schools and communities , " For example , schools can run their own flag discussions and referendums to mirror the formal process as part of their own learning exercise " . 

<root> People were encouraged to submit their designs online at www.flag.govt.nz and suggest what the flag should mean on www.standfor.co.nz . 

<root> Names of participants would be engraved , at their option , on a flag pole monument to be built in the nation 's capital , Wellington . 

<root> New Zealand 's Prime Minister John Key said he believes redesigning the flag now has a " strong rationale " . 

<root> Mr Key promoted the campaign for a unique New Zealand flag on Waitangi Day - February 6 - this year . 

<root> Of the public process , he said , " In the end I 'll have one vote in each referendum just like every other New Zealander on the electoral roll " . 

<root> The New Zealand government intends to hold two referendums to reach a verdict on the flag , at an estimated cost of NZ $ 26 million , although a recent poll found only a quarter of citizens favoured changing the flag . 

<root> This is a decrease from the year before , when it was forty percent . 

<root> The first referendum is to be held from November 20 to December 11 , selecting a single new flag design out of about four finalists . 

<root> Voters would then choose between the new flag and their current flag early in 2016 .

<root> Wikinews has learned that according to an Internet posting made just over 24 hours ago , the Church of Scientology 's website is being attacked by hackers , causing the site to shut down . 

<root> The attack was launched on Wednesday by a user labelled " Anonymous " , on the website " Insurgency Wiki " , a spinoff of 4chan . 

<root> The " History " section of the site explains , in a satirical fashion , that the incident was prompted by the Church of Scientology 's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from YouTube . 

<root> Though YouTube is complying with the Church of Scientology 's requests to take down the video , other sites such as Gawker.com have stated that they will keep hosting the video . 

<root> " So far , it 's the Internet : 1 , Scientology : 0 . But it 's a long game . " - Matthew Ingram 

<root> Writing in a blog post , Matthew Ingram of The Globe and Mail dubbed the ongoing conflict involving the Church of Scientology 's attempts to remove the Cruise video from the Internet : " Scientology vs. the Internet , part XVII " . 

<root> He characterized the conflict between the Church of Scientology and anonymous posters of the Cruise video as " another small skirmish in a war that Scientology has been waging for almost 15 years , since the early days of newsgroups such as alt.religion.scientology , which posted internal church documents in 1994 . 

<root> Lawsuits have been filed , mailing lists have been shut down , homes of discussion group participants have been raided and their computers seized -- an all-out war . " 

<root> " Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video , a new obsession is taking hold on the internet . An insurgency against The Church of Scientology . " Anonymous blogger , " Anon declares war on Church of Scientology " 

<root> One poster admitted to being a part of the effort , writing in a blog post " I have myself , as per instructions , loaded up Gigaloader and started bombarding the Scientology homepage . 

<root> There s [ sic ] something in the hilarious anarchy of the net that produces these ' events ' every now and again . " 

<root> The poster wrote that " Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video , a new obsession is taking hold on the internet . 

<root> An insurgency against The Church of Scientology . " 

<root> " Someone emailed me earlier today talking about a tool a group ’s been using to attack the scientology website . 

<root> It ’s an interesting tool , created to overload/create malformed strings and crash a website ’s database , " said the post by an unknown author on pigmy . 

<root> The Church 's website is currently unreachable . 

<root> Some individuals reported that when they are able to reach the site , all they get is a message stating , " The word scientology means search for truth ... " . 

<root> As of 15:11 GMT the site was accessible again , but only loads at relatively slow speeds , and by the end of the day Saturday the site was not loading at all . 

<root> Posts on the message board for the Scientology-critic site Operation Clambake from Friday theorized that a denial-of-service attack had occurred , and wrote that as of Friday the Scientology.org site was either not loading at all , or loading very slowly . 

<root> Critics of Scientology at the Internet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology were critical of the attacks to the Church of Scientology website , with one poster writing " How can people look at both sides if one side is gone ? " 

<root> Traffic to the Scientology website had already increased 18-fold prior to the attack , following increased attention after the Tom Cruise video appeared on the Internet . 

<root> At that time , one in three visits to the site came from BBC News , and the website increased to number 3 in the company Hitwise UK 's Lifestyle-Religion category . 

<root> Microsoft waits for death of Internet Explorer 6 

<root> Tuesday , March 8 , 2011 

<root> With development of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 9 ( IE9 ) browser almost complete , Microsoft announced on Friday that it is time for IE6 users to move away from the antiquated 10-year-old browser . 

<root> Microsoft has replaced it with three newer versions . 

<root> On a new website , " The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown " , Microsoft has launched an aggressive campaign to persuade users to stop using IE6 and update to a newer IE . 

<root> Its goal is to decrease IE6 users to less than one percent . 

<root> " [ Ten ] years ago , a browser was born . 

<root> Its name was Internet Explorer 6 . 

<root> Now that we ’re in 2011 , in an era of modern web standards , it ’s time to say goodbye , " Microsoft says on " The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown " . 

<root> Internet Explorer 's market share is slipping . 

<root> IE 's various versions accounted for 70 percent of the market in 2009 ; this has dropped to approximately 56 percent today . 

<root> Mozilla Firefox , its main rival , has been actively increasing its market share while the recently released Google Chrome is also quickly gaining users . 

<root> PC World 's recent analysis of its own web traffic statistics concluded , " Usually , Internet Explorer is the # 2 browser after Firefox , but over the past 30 days it s been # 3 , a couple of points behind Safari - and nearly tied with Chrome . 

<root> It might be a statistical blip . 

<root> But if it is n't , and Chrome continues to surge , IE could fall to fourth place . " 

<root> Web developers face big problems with IE6 . 

<root> As they design their web pages for the newer browsers with advanced web technology and geared to the newest web core markup language HTML 5 , they are forced to accommodate older out-of-date technology to support IE6 users . 

<root> Also , not mentioned on Microsoft 's " The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown " site , are the numerous security vulnerabilities putting the browser at risk of being hacked . 

<root> The Internet security firm Secunia.com , has said that as of March 4 , 2011 , IE6 has 277 vulnerabilities ; 39 percent of these are rated " highly critical " . 

<root> Microsoft says that the latest versions of Internet Explorer provide the user with enhanced protection from these attacks and threats . 

<root> Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 6 is one of the most successful software products ever as measured by its durability and the massive numbers of people who have used it . 

<root> IE6 shipped with Windows XP , nearly a decade ago . 

<root> But it has outlived its usefulness , and Microsoft no longer wants to support it . 

<root> Australian woman claims Church of Scientology imprisoned her for twelve years 

<root> Thursday , May 7 , 2015 

<root> Valeska Paris , an Australian woman and former Scientologist , has claimed that the Church of Scientology imprisoned her for twelve years aboard the Scientology - owned cruise ship , Freewinds . 

<root> The Church of Scientology 's cruise ship Freewinds in Bonaire . 

<root> Paris was born in Switzerland but her parents moved her to the United Kingdom when she was six so they could be closer to the church 's headquarters . 

<root> She joined the Sea Org aged 14 . 

<root> In 1995 , at age seventeen , she was told to disconnect from her mother . 

<root> Paris claims she was first sent to the ship aged eighteen for two weeks as a teenager but ended up spending twelve years there . 

<root> Paris also claims that her passport was taken away from her and she was forced to work in the engine room . 

<root> I was basically hauled in and told that my mum had attacked the church and that I needed to disconnect from her because she was suppressive . Valeska Paris 

<root> I was basically hauled in and told that my mum had attacked the church and that I needed to disconnect from her because she was suppressive . 

<root> Her mother had spoken out against Scientology on French television after her ex-husband and Paris 's father , Albert Jaquier , committed suicide after he lost his fortune to Scientology . 

<root> Paris claims that she was kept at Flag Land Base in Clearwater , Florida until she was eighteen and then transferred to the Freewinds . 

<root> On board the Freewinds , Paris claims that she was working from 6:00am to midnight and due to lack of sleep ended up being a walking zombie . 

<root> She also claims that in 1997 and 1998 , she was tasked with removal of asbestos from the ship . 

<root> In 2007 , Paris left the ship after a confrontation with the ship 's management . 

<root> She was eventually sent to Rehabilitation Project Force in Sydney , which the Church describes as a religious retreat , but critics charge is a forced work camp . 

<root> Here , she met her future husband and subsequently left the church . 

<root> In a statement to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , the Church denied these allegations : 

<root> She certainly was n't ' forced ' to be there . 

<root> She was also never forced to perform labour in the engine room . 

<root> They also claimed Paris was a volunteer and claim she has a vested interest for misrepresenting her experiences with the Church . 

<root> The Church also claims that Paris not having her passport was maritime procedure . 

<root> North Korea puts military in ' quasi-state of war ' 

<root> Friday , August 21 , 2015 

<root> According to Yonhap news agency , quoting North Korea 's main news agency Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) , the country 's military has been placed on high alert and has been told to prepare a " quasi-state of war " . 

<root> The report comes after North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire yesterday . 

<root> " War maniacs of the South Korean puppet military made another grave provocation to the DPRK in the central western sector of the front on Thursday afternoon . 

<root> They perpetrated such reckless action as firing 36 shells at KPA civil police posts under the absurd pretext that the KPA fired one shell at the south side . 

<root> Six shells of them hit the area near KPA civil police posts 542 and 543 and other 15 shells fell near KPA civil police posts 250 and 251 " , said KCNA . 

<root> " Foolhardy provocation deserves harsh punishment " , it added ; and , later , " Kim Jong-un issued an order of the supreme commander of the Korean People 's Army [ KPA ] that the front-line large combined units of the KPA should enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations " . 

<root> Yesterday , North Korea fired artillery rounds aimed at a loudspeaker in South Korea that broadcasts anti-Pyongyang propaganda into the North . 

<root> " Commanders of the Korean People 's Army were hastily dispatched to the front-line troops to command military operations to destroy psychological warfare tools if the enemy does not stop the propaganda broadcast within 48 hours and prepare against the enemy 's possible counteractions " , added KCNA . 

<root> No injuries or deaths were reported in the attacks from either side , but South Korea evacuated about 80 people in the town of Yeoncheon after at least one shell landed near the area . 

<root> The South retaliated by firing dozens of rounds of artillery into the north . 

<root> South Korea had recently started to broadcast propaganda from loudspeakers after an 11-year lull . 

<root> The broadcasts began on August 10 and South Korea says the broadcasts will continue . 

<root> After the exchange of fire , North Korea stated it would attack any loudspeakers broadcasting propaganda and would respond , militarily , within 48 hours if the broadcasts do not stop . 

<root> Both countries have put their militaries on high levels of alert . 

<root> Lantern Festival in Taipei lights up the night 

<root> Monday , March 5 , 2007 

<root> Taipei , Taiwan — The Taipei City Lantern Festival was off to a bright start on Saturday Night as hundreds of thousands of people crowded onto the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial near downtown Taipei to witness city mayor Hau Lung-bin and other dignitaries ceremoniously flip the switch to light hundreds of colorful lantern scenes in and around the 240,000 square meter memorial park . 

<root> The centerpiece of this rock concert-like performance is a 15 meter high rotating pig equipped with a fog machine , laser light show and theme music . 

<root> The theme of this years lantern festival revolves around the 12 year Chinese zodiac cycles year of the pig . 

<root> Its round shape symbolizes wealth and good fortune and is believed to bring good luck . 

<root> Started in 1990 , the Taipei lantern festival continues a 2000 year old tradition of light related festivals marking the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations . 

<root> This particular event grows in popularity every year . 

<root> Last Year over 4 million visitors attended the event and this year the city expects about 6 million visitors according to the event website . 

<root> Colorful lantern scenes not only fill the central square but also the surrounding 2 km circumference of the memorial . 

<root> Each section has a theme . 

<root> One side of the memorial is scenes made by student groups while other areas represent the counties of Taiwan . 

<root> There is even a section of lanterns sponsored by foreign countries . 

<root> The Malaysia Tourism board was quite prominent at the main entrance to the grounds . 

<root> As with all new year celebrations in Taiwan , the lantern festival is crowded . 

<root> People flock to see the lantern scenes and enjoy the festival atmosphere as they carry lanterns , given away by the city and bought from street vendors at the event . 

<root> The many light toys such a swords , devil ears , and lanterns turn the milling crowd into a unique light show that can be observed by climbing the steps of the 70 meter memorial hall on the grounds . 

<root> Local public transportation hubs are often swamped by the event . 

<root> The station staff at Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall Station do an excellent job of crowd control but lines for the subway can still be hours long and very exhausting . 

<root> A sudden rain storm on Sunday night ( March 4 ) caused a mass exodus of people to head for the station prompting lines that backed up into the street . 

<root> The commuting crowds can be avoided however by walking from NTU Hospital Station or Shandao Station . 

<root> Both of these stops are only about a 20 minute walk from the event and have no crowds at all . 

<root> If you really want to avoid the crowds , definitely avoid the weekends . 

<root> Wait until the fourth or fifth day of the festival when the crowds will have dwindled . 

<root> I visited the festival on Saturday night , the opening night , and there was a sea of people in the square . 

<root> I went back the next Tuesday night and there was almost no one there , just a few stray photographers taking advantage of the unimpeded views of the lanterns . 

<root> The festival runs through March 11 this year . 

<root> Hundreds dead in Hajj stampede 

<root> Thursday , January 12 , 2006 

<root> The Plains of Arafat on the day of Hajj 

<root> According to the Saudi Interior Ministry over 345 Muslim pilgrims have been killed in a stampede during the annual Hajj pilgrimage near Mecca , Saudi Arabia . 

<root> The stampede at Islam 's most holy site happened at Jamarat Bridge , during an event where pebbles are thrown at a pillar to represent the stoning of Satan as part of the final rites of the Hajj . 

<root> The stampede began when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall , causing a bottleneck . 

<root> Those who were tripped were then crushed by the wave of people behind them . 

<root> Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca during their lifetimes , if physically or financially possible , as it is one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith . 

<root> Saudi officials had already provided safeguards by installing an oval wall with padded edges to protect pilgrams from a crush , installed security cameras and placed over 60,000 security personnel in the area . 

<root> This is not the first time deadly stampedes have taken place during the Hajj , with the deadliest stampede during the 1991 Hajj , in which 1,426 pilgrims were trampled . 

<root> Last week , at least 76 people were killed when the Al-Ghaza Hotel near the Masjid Al-Haram ( Grand Mosque ) collasped , the cause of which is unknown . 

<root> Local municipalities in Italy ask taxes from religious schools 

<root> Sunday , August 2 , 2015 

<root> In the past few days in Italy , several municipalities have started asking religious schools to pay taxes for property and local services , despite the resistance of the Catholic Church . 

<root> Instituto Gonzaga , a catholic school in Milan . Image : Friedrichstrasse . 

<root> The request of the municipalities results from the sentence of the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on July 8 , recognising as legitimate the request of the Municipality of Livorno asking religious schools to pay property taxes . 

<root> Requests have come from the Municipality of Bogliasco , next to Genova , and from the deputies of Movimento 5 Stelle ( M5S ) of the regional counsel of Lombardy . 

<root> The first case is of the mayor Luca Pastorino that in last years received several refusals of his requests for payment because of the religious nursery school and retirement home . 

<root> In the second case , the M5S party asks to the regional government to assure the local administrations of the region regularly apply the sentence of the Supreme Court . 

<root> The case on which the Court has ruled was of the religious schools Santo Spirito and Immacolata in Livorno , Tuscany , to pay over 422,000 euros in arrears for the period from 2004 to 2009 . 

<root> The request was advanced by the Municipality of Livorno in 2010 . 

<root> The city reasoned , " because the users of the private schools pay a frequency fee , this kind of activity is considered as a commercial one " ( ( it ) ) . 

<root> In 2014 the Italian municipal tax discipline has changed from the ICI system to the IMU system by the Monti government . 

<root> A mean cost per student criterion is used to tax only the schools that receive a fee higher than the mean cost per student fixed by the State . 

<root> The new law is not retroactive , so the taxes requested in arrears from 2006 to 2009 are under the ICI system . 

<root> Minister of Education Stefania Giannini said a " more general reflection " ( ( it ) ) is needed . 

<root> Claudio De Vincenti , undersecretary to the prime minister , said " a discussion table will be opened with the non-profit associations , religious association included " ( ( it ) ) . 

<root> Undersecretary for Education Mr. Toccafondi says " many schools will increase their fees or they will quit . Then the State will have to find new resources to build new structures and manage them " ( ( it ) ) . 

<root> Also the president of the Lombardy region , Roberto Maroni , has reacted by proposing some regional counter-measures to finance private schools . 

<root> The secretary general of CEI ( Italian Episcopal Conference ) , Nunzio Galantino , has called the sentence " dangerous " ( ( it ) ) and " ideological " ( ( it ) ) : 

<root> " We face a dangerous sentence . 

<root> Who takes the decisions , do it with less ideology . 

<root> Because I have the clear sensation that with this way of thinking , they wait the praise of some ideologized supporters . 

<root> Indeed , they do n't understand what kind of good service private schools held " ( ( it ) ) . 

<root> Italian secularist associations are concerned the Government will modify the law in order to maintain an exception for religious schools . 

<root> The secularist magazine MicroMega describe the court 's judgement as historic . 

<root> The Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics ( UAAR ) has launched a petition which now has more than 11,000 signatures , asking the government to respect and execute the sentence of the Supreme Court . 

<root> It is also encouraging citizens to ask for application of the law in their local municipalities .

<root> Evansville , Indiana , United States - 

<root> This past week marked the opening night of an Andy Warhol exhibit at the University of Southern Indiana . 

<root> USI 's art gallery , like 189 other educational galleries and museums around the country , is a recipient of a major Warhol donor program , and this program is cultivating new interest in Warhol 's photographic legacy . 

<root> Wikinews reporters attended the opening and spoke to donors , exhibit organizers and patrons . 

<root> The USI art gallery celebrated the Thursday opening with its display of Warhol 's Polaroids , gelatin silver prints and several colored screen prints . 

<root> USI 's exhibit , which is located in Evansville , Indiana , is to run from January 23 through March 9 . 

<root> Full interview with Kristin Wilkins , curator of the exhibition at the University of Southern Indiana . 

<root> Audio : Jkthom . 

<root> The McCutchan Art Center / Pace Galleries at USI bases its exhibit around roughly 100 Polaroids selected from its collection . 

<root> The Polaroids were all donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program , according to Kristen Wilkins , assistant professor of photography and curator of the exhibit . 

<root> The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts made two donations to USI Art Collections , in 2007 and a second recently . 

<root> Kathryn Waters , director of the gallery , expressed interest in further donations from the foundation in the future . 

<root> Since 2007 the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program has seeded university art galleries throughout the United States with over 28,000 Andy Warhol photographs and other artifacts . 

<root> The program takes a decentralized approach to Warhol 's photography collection and encourages university art galleries to regularly disseminate and educate audiences about Warhol 's artistic vision , especially in the area of photography .

<root> Wikinews provides additional video , audio and photographs so our readers may learn more . 

<root> Wilkins observed that the 2007 starting date of the donation program , which is part of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts , coincided with the 20th anniversary of Andy Warhol 's death in 1987 . 

<root> USI was not alone in receiving a donation . 

<root> K.C. Maurer , chief financial officer and treasurer at the Andy Warhol Foundation , said 500 institutions received the initial invitation and currently 190 universities have accepted one or more donations . 

<root> Institutional recipients , said Mauer , are required to exhibit their donated Warhol photographs every ten years as one stipulation . 

<root> While USI is holding its exhibit , there are also Warhol Polaroid exhibits at the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs , New York and an Edward Steichen and Andy Warhol exhibit at the Mary & Leigh Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois . 

<root> All have received Polaroids from the foundation . 

<root> University exhibits can reach out and attract large audiences . 

<root> For example , the Weatherspoon Art Museum at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro saw attendance levels reach 11,000 visitors when it exhibited its Warhol collection in 2010 , according to curator Elaine Gustafon . 

<root> That exhibit was part of a collaboration combining the collections from Duke University , located in Durham , North Carolina , and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , which also were recipients of donated items from the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program . 

<root> Superstars 

<root> Each collection donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program holds Polaroids of well-known celebrities . 

<root> The successful UNC Greensboro exhibit included Polaroids of author Truman Capote and singer-songwriter Carly Simon . 

<root> " I think America 's obsession with celebrity culture is as strong today as it was when Warhol was living " , said Gustafon . 

<root> " People are still intrigued by how stars live , dress and socialize , since it is so different from most people 's every day lives . " 

<root> Wilkins explained Warhol 's obsession with celebrities began when he first collected head shots as a kid and continued as a passion throughout his life . 

<root> " He 's hanging out with the celebrities , and has kind of become the same sort of celebrity he was interested in documenting earlier in his career " , Wilkins said . 

<root> The exhibit at USI includes Polaroids of actor Dennis Hopper ; musician Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran ; publishers Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone Magazine and Carlo De Benedetti of Italy 's la Repubblica ; disco club owner Steve Rubell of Studio 54 ; photographers Nat Finkelstein , Christopher Makos and Felice Quinto ; and athletes Vitas Gerulaitis ( tennis ) and Jack Nicklaus ( golf ) . 

<root> Wikinews observed the USI exhibit identifies and features Polaroids of fashion designer Halston , a former resident of Evansville . 

<root> University collections across the United States also include Polaroids of " unknowns " who have not yet had their fifteen minutes of fame . 

<root> Scientists analyse effects of global warming , atmospheric ozone on crops 

<root> Monday , July 28 , 2014 

<root> A research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Colorado State University of the US and the University of Sheffield of the UK has analysed effects of global warming and ozone pollution over 2000 - 2050 on the worldwide production of wheat , rice , maize and soybean . 

<root> The study was published in journal Nature Climate Change yesterday . 

<root> The scientists found reduction of crop yields by 2050 exceeded 10 % of 2000 levels , substantially decreasing food security , in all cases examined . 

<root> Several scenarios were considered because of uncertainty of future levels of ozone pollution . 

<root> They estimated by 2050 , increasing population and changing diet would increase world food needs by 50 percent . 

<root> As coauthor Colette Heald told The Huffington Post , " The climate projections are quite consistent [...] 

<root> the future of ozone pollution is very different [...] leading to either offsetting or reinforcing effects [ of climate change ] on crops " . 

<root> By 2050 , undernourishment would increase by either 49 percent or by 27 percent , depending on the scenario . 

<root> The study focuses on ozone-temperature covariation : ground-level ozone increases with temperatures . 

<root> Heald said although temperature and ozone are separately known to impact crop yields , " nobody has looked at these together " . 

<root> Depending on region and crops , the yields may be primarily sensitive to ozone - in the case of wheat - or heat - in the case of maize - alone , providing a local estimation of relative benefits of climate change adaptation versus ozone regulation . 

<root> The U.S. Department of Agriculture notes , " Ground-level ozone causes more damage to plants than all other air pollutants combined " , highlighting the importance of air quality for agriculture . 

<root> Results of NCLAN studies , published in a paper by AS Heagle in 1989 , show dicot species , such as soybean , cotton , and peanut , lose more yield from ozone than do monocot species such as sorghum , field corn , and winter wheat . 

<root> The researchers found that ozone pollution caused 46 percent of previously heat-attributed damage to soybean crops . 

<root> The model does not include the effect of rising carbon dioxide concentration , which has complex and potentially offsetting impacts on global food supply . 

<root> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says some crops may have higher yields with increased levels of carbon dioxide . 

<root> However , global warming also increases probability of extreme crops-damaging weather events such as floods , droughts , and extreme temperatures . 

<root> Climate change affects distribution of weeds , pests , and diseases . 

<root> Heald noted the findings show pollution reduction is also important . 

<root> " An air-quality cleanup would improve crop yields [...] 

<root> Ozone is something that we understand the causes of , and the steps that need to be taken to improve air quality . " 

<root> As Heald told The Huffington Post , US surface ozone has dropped partly due to the Clean Air Act . 

<root> " Despite an increase in vehicle miles driven and energy consumption , surface ozone has declined by 25 percent on average across the U.S. from 1980 to 2012 [...] 

<root> However , the future of ozone air quality in the U.S. and around the world will depend on local emissions , the use of pollution control technology , regulations , and air quality policy . " 

<root> The study was supported by the Croucher Foundation , US National Science Foundation , and US National Park Service . 

<root> Greek court rules worship of ancient Greek deities is legal 

<root> Monday , March 27 , 2006 

<root> Greek court has ruled that worshippers of the ancient Greek religion may now formally associate and worship at archeological sites . 

<root> Prior to the ruling , the religion was banned from conducting public worship at archeological sites by the Greek Ministry of Culture . 

<root> Due to that , the religion was relatively secretive . 

<root> The Greek Orthodox Church , a Christian denomination , is extremely critical of worshippers of the ancient deities . 

<root> Today , about 100,000 Greeks worship the ancient gods , such as Zeus , Hera , Poseidon , Aphrodite , and Athena . 

<root> The Greek Orthodox Church estimates that number is closer to 40,000 . 

<root> Many neo-pagan religions , such as Wicca , use aspects of ancient Greek religions in their practice ; Hellenic polytheism instead focuses exclusively on the ancient religions , as far as the fragmentary nature of the surviving source material allows . 

<root> The Chatham Islands 

<root> The Chatnam Islands ( Rekohu in the indigenous Moriori language ) are the eastern-most settled islands in New Zealand . 

<root> The islands are in their own time zone , 45 minutes ahead of New Zealand time ; 

<root> the International Date Line jogs eastward to keep them on the same calendar day as the rest of New Zealand . 

<root> The islands lie 860 km east of Christchurch , in the middle of the " Roaring Forties " . 

<root> Steeped in culture and history , these islands are on the very edge of civilisation . 

<root> Experience Moriori culture , experience Rekohu . 

<root> Understand 

<root> The Chatham Islands consist of the main island , Chatham Island itself , with a population of 600 , smaller Pitt Island with about 40 inhabitants , and a number of rocky outcrops . 

<root> The islands are volcanic in origin and have a unique and sensitive habitat that supports many rare and endangered species . 

<root> The original people of the islands are the Moriori , who were descended from the Maori of mainland New Zealand , but who developed their own culture and variant of the language . 

<root> In 1835 Maori settlers from the mainland arrived , massacred and enslaved the Moriori . 

<root> Get in 

<root> By plane 

<root> The only way for visitors to travel to the Chathams is via scheduled or chartered air service . 

<root> Air Chathams fly 5 days per week , from either Christchurch , Auckland or Wellington and , seasonally , from Napier . 

<root> The plane is based in the Chathams and flies to mainland New Zealand in the morning , then back to the Chathams in the afternoon . 

<root> As part of New Zealand , there are no passport or visa requirements and no border controls on arrival from the mainland . 

<root> You should book or ensure accommodation before you board a flight for the Chathams , as during the popular months of the tourism season , between October and April , accommodation can be severely limited . 

<root> There are no same-day return flights , so once there you have to stay at least one night . 

<root> Although flying to the Chathams and back is not cheap , it is worth it . 

<root> Even the mainland school groups that fly there for school camps , and choose to stay at Kopinga Marae [ 1 ] get value for money by chartering a flight one way . 

<root> Anyway , you do n't have a choice on how you get there , unless you happen to own an aeroplane . 

<root> However , when you get off that aeroplane , if you have n't pre-organised transport , you will have to walk , and it is a long way into town . 

<root> By boat 

<root> The only scheduled shipping service to the Chatham Islands remains the Black Robin Freighters " Rangatira " , an antiquated , slow and small coastal trading vessel . 

<root> This boat has serviced the islands for many years , but does not carry passengers . 

<root> Freight charges on the Rangatira appear to be flexible and subject to change . 

<root> Vessels can call at the Chathams and there are a number of " safe " harbours for shelter if the need arises . 

<root> Remember to notify the local policeman , or Ministry of Fisheries officer if you are entering New Zealand via the Chathams .

<root> Cleveland is a culturally diverse city on the shores of Lake Erie , one of the Great Lakes , in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , USA . 

<root> Recreational , cultural and educational opportunities are abundant throughout Northeast Ohio . 

<root> You ll find world-class museums and cultural events , professional sports and amusement parks , and the most golf courses per capita in the United States . 

<root> Places Rated Almanac ranks the area second in recreational options out of 354 US metro areas . 

<root> Plus , this region ranks fifth in the nation in number of major cultural resources per one million residents . 

<root> Understand 

<root> Cleveland from lakefront . 

<root> Cleveland is the urban center of Northeast Ohio , the 15th largest combined metropolitan area in the United States . 

<root> Throughout the twentieth century , the City of Cleveland proper was ranked as one of the 10 largest cities in the U.S. ( from 1890 until 1970 per US Census Bureau statistics ) . 

<root> Like most U.S. cities , Cleveland proper began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s . 

<root> However , in the mid-1980s , Cleveland earned the nickname the " Comeback City " as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today . 

<root> As its " comeback " has continued , the official moniker is now the New American City as Cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning . 

<root> Despite the common perception that Cleveland is an industrial town , just beyond the automotive and steel plants , a clean and beautiful downtown rises at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on the southern shore of Lake Erie ( often marvelled over by visitors who are surprised you ca n't see the other side , i.e. , Canada ) . 

<root> Like other cities in the so-called " rust belt “ , Cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy . 

<root> While Cleveland continues to play a leading role in building the U.S. industrial base , it has also developed economic prowess in the fields of health care , law , finance , insurance , real estate development , and professional services . 

<root> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum 

<root> Another thing non-locals do n't often realize is that Cleveland 's long history of industrial wealth has left it chock full of cultural riches as well as the beginnings of a " sustainable city " movement . 

<root> Serving as a global model for urban rebirth , Cleveland has been named one of the top 10 international visitor hotspots by Travel and Leisure magazine . 

<root> For decades , the city has boasted of : a " Big Five " orchestra ( The Cleveland Orchestra ) , the second largest performing arts center in the U.S. ( Playhouse Square Center ) , a world-renowned art museum ( The Cleveland Museum of Art ) , the nation 's first health museum ( HealthSpace Cleveland ) , R&D hub of the aerospace and aviation industry ( the NASA Glenn Research & Visitors Center ) and a number of other first-rate attractions ( too many to mention here - read on ) . 

<root> During its " comeback " years , Cleveland has added : the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum , the Great Lakes Science Center with Omnimax theatre , and four new sports facilities in the downtown area - Progressive Field ( Still known as " The Jake " after a recent corporate name change ) for the Major League Baseball Indians , QuickenLoans Arena ( " The Q " ) for the NBA Cavaliers , Cleveland Browns Stadium for the NFL Browns and the Wolstein Center for the Cleveland State University Vikings basketball team . 

<root> Get in 

<root> For information specific to U.S. citizens see Americans in Cuba 

<root> Visa and legal issues 

<root> A tourist visa card ( visa de tarjeta del turista ) is necessary for travelers from most nations . 

<root> This visa , which is really little more than a piece of paper on which you list your vital statistics , costs between 15 - 25 CUC ( or € 15 - 25 ) , depending on where purchased . 

<root> It can be purchased at the Airport in Cuba on arrival , however it should be noted that many airlines will require a valid tourist visa card before boarding flights . 

<root> It is usually valid for 30 days and can be extended once for another 30 days at any immigration office in Cuba ( for 25 CUC ) - beyond this you would need a flight out of Cuba within the extended visa period . 

<root> Canadians are the exception , getting 90 days on arrival and can apply for a 90 day extension . 

<root> Your passport needs to be valid at least six months past the end of your planned return . 

<root> Canadian passports must be valid for at least one month beyond the date of expected departure ( [ 2 ] ) . 

<root> From Canada , the tourist card is normally provided on the flight . 

<root> It can also be purchased from most Latin American gateway airports if departing from there ( Cancun : 250 MXN , Mexico City : USD 25 ) . 

<root> Please note that if departing from Europe ( this may apply to other countries ) , you will require to have the visa before boarding the plane . 

<root> Some times , the airline provides these at the airport , however check first that this is the case . 

<root> Without a valid visa , boarding will be denied ( the airline would otherwise get a $ 1,000 fine from the Cuban immigration authorities ) . 

<root> Country-specific advise 

<root> UK : Applying for the visa is a very simple process and can be done by post or in person at the Cuban embassy in London . 

<root> When applying to the Cuban Consulate by post , there is a new charge introduced in 2011 which is a £ 25 for a non-personal transaction . 

<root> If you cannot go to the Cuban Consulate you may consider using VisaCuba ( [ 3 ] ) because it may be cheaper . 

<root> Through them it may cost £ 20 in total per person . 

<root> If you apply in person to the Cuban Consulate , you get the visa straight away . 

<root> It can also be done through online agencies as mentioned before although they may be slightly more expensive ( normally £ 15 + £ 15 admin fee and additional postage ) . 

<root> Germany : You can obtain the tourist card through the Cuban embassy in post . 

<root> Travel agencies may often offer cheaper and quicker services though . 

<root> Regular tourists who renew their 30 day visa are eligible to depart the country ( to any destination ) and return immediately enjoying a further 60 days ( 30 days plus a 30 day extension ) . 

<root> You are only allowed two consecutive stays in this manner . 

<root> If you want to stay with friends or family in Cuba you have to go with your intended host within two days after arrival to a migration office and pay 40 CUC for a 30 days family visa . 

<root> Citizens of Antigua and Barbuda ( 28 days ) , Barbados ( 28 days ) , Benin , Bosnia and Herzegovina , CIS ( except Ukraine and Uzbekistan ) , Dominica , Grenada ( 60 days ) , Liechtenstein ( 90 days ) , Macedonia , Malaysia ( 90 days ) , Mongolia , Montenegro ( 90 days ) , Namibia , Singapore , Slovakia , Saint Kitts and Nevis , Saint Lucia , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , Serbia ( 90 days ) , Turkmenistan who can stay 30 days without visa . 

<root> ( The source of the previous sentence is unknown . 

<root> Aeromexico staff at Cancun airport claim that only citizens of China and Russia need no visa . 

<root> It is important to note that there is also a departure tax of CUC 25 , to be paid in cash when departing Cuba by airplane ; this is not required for boat departures . 

<root> This tax is not well publicized but it is essential to remember it . 

<root> You will run into significant difficulties if you do not have enough cash to pay this tax when leaving the country . 

<root> An ATM and currency exchange are available at Havana airport , but these facilities are not as reliable in Cuba as in other places . 

<root> Cuban customs can be strict , though they sometimes go easy on tourists . 

<root> Fort Lee 

<root> Fort Lee is a city in Bergen County . 

<root> View of the George Washington Bridge 's long span and Manhattan , as seen while looking east from Fort Lee Historic Park 

<root> Understand 

<root> Fort Lee is located between the Paramus , NJ retail corridor and Upper Manhattan . 

<root> This town is comprised of a large residential community that includes Fort Lee natives , transplants from New York , and immigrants , especially from Korea . 

<root> This cultural diversity is represented through the vast variety of international restaurants and small business , and in particular , there is a strong Korean presence that can be seen in retail and dining storefronts . 

<root> Fort Lee is a small town but is piled high with apartment buildings . 

<root> Because Fort Lee is situated above the banks of the Hudson River , there are breathtaking views from almost any window facing the river . 

<root> The New York City skyline and 4th of July fireworks are spectacular over the river . 

<root> Although it is highly built up , Fort Lee also houses many playing fields and recreational parks as well as bike and running trails . 

<root> And although there is a great deal of vehicle traffic to and from the George Washington Bridge , which connects Fort Lee with Manhattan , one of the largest perks of this town is the walking access to many restaurants , convenience stores and mass transit , in the form of buses and vans that frequently run across the bridge and up and down major streets .

<root> Most people choose cars , but if headed to a central area , such as Main Street , it is best to drive there , park in a municipal parking lot , and walk around from there . 

<root> Since so much of the town ’s retail area is clustered in 3 or 4 block radius , it would be beneficial to walk around , but might also be dangerous given the high traffic intersections . 

<root> If walking use caution , and if parking , make sure to feed the meter with plenty of pocket change ; the meter maids take their job very seriously . 

<root> Since fort lee is situated in such a convenient area for those commuting to and from the city , there is often high traffic and congestion on the roads . 

<root> If you are planning on being somewhere at a certain time , one might suggest leaving a good 10 to 15 minutes to escape local traffic before hitting any major roadways .

<root> Łódź 

<root> Łódź ( Pronounced : Wootch ) is Poland 's third biggest city , and the capital of the Łódzkie Voivodship . 

<root> Unlike most other large Polish cities , which have long histories , Łódź was created almost from scratch during the 19th century textile industry boom to house textile mills , their owners and their workers , and rapidly grew to become an important industrial and commerce centre . 

<root> In recent years , Łódź has been battling rising unemployment and youth migration resulting from the failing textile industry and is repositioning itself as a hub for design and creative industries . 

<root> Owing to its history , Łódź has an impressive collection of residential , commercial and industrial 19th-century architecture including some of Europe 's largest factory buildings , now mostly repurposed as shopping centres or lofts . 

<root> Recent local investment and a long-standing cultural scene ensures there is always something more to do than just sightseeing or shopping , with the city hosting some of the best museums and art galleries in the country . 

<root> The close proximity of Warsaw and Łódź 's location at the crossroads of the Polish motorway system make it an ideal destination for a day trip or longer city break . 

<root> Understand 

<root> Historic fire station in Księży Młyn area 

<root> Name and history 

<root> The origin of the city 's name is unknown , however , the word łódź translates to " boat " in English . 

<root> This is referred to in the emblem and when you hear the dwellers of Łódź ( łodzianin ( man ) łodzianka ( woman ) łodzianie ( plural ) ) calling themselves " the boat people " . 

<root> A settlement on the area of present-day Łódź was established in the 14th century and in 1423 it was granted a town charter , along with the right to have a marketplace . 

<root> However , the real development of Łódź started with the industrial era at the beginning of the 19th century when the city was chosen to be the heart of the rapidly-growing textile industry . 

<root> The population of Łódź soared from some 4,000 people in the 1830s and 40,000 in 1865 to over 300,000 inhabitants at the turn of the century , which was an unprecedented growth on a worldwide scale . 

<root> The rapid development of Łódź in the second half of the 19th century was brought about by the rise of enormous industrialist fortunes . 

<root> New inhabitants , craftsmen and merchants came to Łódź ; markets and town fairs came to life . 

<root> The profits obtained from prosperous textile mills opened up practically unlimited possibilities for their owners . 

<root> The city residences became expressions of the riches and power of the local tycoons . 

<root> They were usually situated next to the owner 's factory . 

<root> Ever since the industrial revolution brought a massive influx of workforce , Łódź had been a city almost equally divided between four cultures - Polish , Jewish , German and Russian . 

<root> The day before the outbreak of World War II , Łódź was inhabited by approximately 672,000 people , among whom 35 % were of Jewish faith and some 15 % were ethnic German . 

<root> Andrzej Wajda 's movie , Promised Land based on a novel by the Nobel laureate Władysław Reymont , depicts those times and is a worthwhile introduction to the city 's bustling history . 

<root> During the Nazi occupation , Łódź was incorporated directly into the Third Reich . 

<root> The city was renamed to Litzmannstadt , and Piotrkowska Street was called Adolf-Hitler-Strasse . 

<root> The Jewish community was practically wiped out , and many others lost their lives . 

<root> Although the city was not destroyed in the aftermath , the material losses were serious as the machinery , raw materials and finished goods were taken away by the fleeing Nazis . 

<root> The day before the liberation , about 80,000 Germans left Łódź in panic . 

<root> At the beginning of 1945 , the population was estimated at 300,000 . 

<root> Plac Wolności 

<root> Łódź today 

<root> Since the fall of communism in Poland , Łódź has not enjoyed the rapid economic growth cities like Kraków , Warsaw and Wrocław have experienced , and has had to endure the fall of much of its textile industry , rising unemployment and emigration ( within Poland and abroad ) . 

<root> This led to further dilapidation of the investment-starved city , and many of its streets and buildings show profound signs of neglect . 

<root> At first glance , for a city of 760,000 and agglomeration of 1.428,000 , there does not seem to be much to see . 

<root> However , the situation is rapidly changing now with Łódź campaigning and redesigning itself as an up-and-coming destination . 

<root> To accomplish this , Łódź has been capitalizing on its film history - Łódź is jokingly referred to as the " HollyŁódź " of Poland and hosts several film festivals and many other cultural events . 

<root> Łódź today may not have the glitz and glamour of its heyday ; however , there is a certain charm to Łódź in its partially renovated façades and leitmotivs , not to mention its grand artistic traditions . 

<root> Mérida 

<root> Mérida is the capital of the state of Yucatán in Mexico . 

<root> It has a population of about 750,000 , and is the largest city in the Yucatán Peninsula . 

<root> Catedral de San Ildefonso 

<root> Zócalo or Main Plaza , with the Cathedral in the distance 

<root> Understand 

<root> Mérida is a city of contrasts . 

<root> You will find elegant hotels , restaurants and malls in the northern part of the city . 

<root> Downtown , there are hotels and restaurants to suit every budget . 

<root> A large central market and numerous small shops are found all around the main plaza . 

<root> Mérida has a rich cultural life which also reflects its diversity . 

<root> Many free concerts , performances and other events are held daily . 

<root> The city was founded by the Spanish conquistadors in the 1540s on top of a centuries-old Maya city called T'ho . 

<root> The palatial home of the family of conquistador leader Montejo can still be seen on the south side of the Zócalo or main square . 

<root> Here and there bits of ancient Maya stonework can be seen reused in Spanish Colonial era buildings in the old part of town . 

<root> From the later 1800s to the 1920s Mérida enjoyed prosperous boom times fueled by the henequen or sisal plant harvest , which made Yucatán the rope maker to the world . 

<root> Progressive Mérida had electric trams and street lights before Mexico City . 

<root> The wealthy constructed the grand Pasejo Montejo avenue north of the old town , inspired by the Champs-Élysées in Paris . 

<root> With the development of artificial twines the sisal boom ended , and Mérida slowed to a more sleepy provincial capital until development picked back up in the late 20th century . 

<root> The city 's ambiance is colonial and the climate is tropical . 

<root> The daytime temperature varies ; in January , it is about 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) and in June , about 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) . 

<root> To beat the heat , most people are busiest in the mornings . 

<root> They have lunch and siesta , then go back to work for a few hours in the late afternoon . 

<root> The cool breezes from the Gulf of Mexico drift into Mérida in the evenings and this is when many of the residents spend their time outdoors . 

<root> You can see them visiting and talking as they stroll along the streets , sit in the plazas or dine in the many sidewalk restaurants . 

<root> From Mérida , it is easy to take day trips to a vast array of destinations : archaeological sites , ecological parks , typical villages , caves , beaches , colonial missions and more . 

<root> Take your time and really explore the Maya sites , walk for miles along the Gulf of Mexico , attend a village festival , photograph the wildlife , crawl through a cave or swim in a cenote .

<root> Phoenix 

<root> Phoenix is the capital of the state of Arizona as well as the most populous city in the American Southwest and sixth largest city in the United States . 

<root> Founded in 1871 , it has become the region 's primary political , cultural , economic , and transportation center . 

<root> At an elevation of 1100 ft ( 335 m ) , it is situated in the biologically unique Sonoran Desert . 

<root> Over time it has merged with the neighboring cities of Scottsdale , Tempe , Glendale , Peoria , Chandler , and Gilbert to form the Greater Phoenix Metropolitan Area . 

<root> Currently exurbs such as Apache Junction , Fountain Hills , Queen Creek , and Sun City are becoming part of this metropolitan area as well . 

<root> Phoenix is extremely hot and dry in the summertime , so always have sunscreen with you ! 

<root> Understand 

<root> Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert ? 

<root> The answer is , surprisingly , agriculture . 

<root> The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century . 

<root> The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture , which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages , whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day . 

<root> White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century . 

<root> The city 's name reflects its history as a city " reborn from the ashes " of the previous settlement . 

<root> European-American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s , and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture . 

<root> Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops , and for many years , intensive , year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy . 

<root> Recent years are seeing a revival , and trendy hotels , bars , shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again . 

<root> Warm and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry , and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix . 

<root> High-tech industry began to flourish after World War II , and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive . 

<root> As a result , a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2014 estimate of 1,537,058 ( with the metro area estimated at 4,489,109 ) . 

<root> Climate 

<root> Phoenix has an arid climate with long , hot summers and very mild winters . 

<root> It has the highest average temperature of any metropolitan area in the States . 

<root> The weather varies enormously from one season to the next . 

<root> While it 's not as cold as in the northern states during the winter , it does freeze sometimes , and temperatures in the 30s ° F ( that 's around or slightly above 0 ° C ) are not unheard of . 

<root> In the summer , very hot and dry heat is the norm . 

<root> On the hottest days , it can get up to 115 ° F ( 46 ° C ) or more . 

<root> Monsoon rains with lightning occur regularly from July to September during the late afternoon and evening , occasionally overnight also . 

<root> April is the most ideal month . 

<root> In some neighborhoods , cicada insects make loud sounds from sunset to sunrise . 

<root> Talk 

<root> English is the dominant language in Phoenix . 

<root> However , like much of the Southwest with a large Hispanic population , Spanish is very widely spoken in Phoenix . 

<root> Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places , although English is the language of preference , especially when dealing with businesses and government .

<root> Due to its remarkable biodiversity , with over a third of the local plant species found nowhere else , Socotra has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 

<root> With over 40,000 inhabitants , though , it 's not just a nature reserve . 

<root> The Island is new to tourism , so if you are looking for a luxurious vacation this is not the right destination . 

<root> However , Socotra is a perfect destination for the adventurous and nature loving travelers . 

<root> Socotra takes pride in their eco-tourism and values their spectacular plant and wildlife that may sometimes be only found on this island . 

<root> Although the lodging and facilities may not be the same as more modern and developed locations , Socotra is a beautiful and magnificent destination choice . 

<root> Great care is shown to both guests and the environment . 

<root> Socotra is an eco-tourism system with limited infrastructure and new to the international tourist market , and therefore the hotel accommodations are not quite like other destinations . 

<root> However there are four hotels in Hadibo : Taj Socotra Hotel , Hafijj Hotel , Socotra Hotel , and Summer land Hotel . 

<root> These hotels may not be the most luxerious , but they do provide air-conditionting , televisions , and refrigerators in all of the rooms . 

<root> Most of the rooms at these hotels have their own bathroom , but there are a few rooms at the Hafijj Hotel and Socotra Hotel that must share bathrooms . 

<root> Fortunately , there is a restaurant in each of the hotels with simple yet delicious cuisine . 

<root> Considering Socotra is a fairly new eco-tourism destination , their facilities are decent . 

<root> In addition , there is also another hotel at the airport as well as multiple guest houses around the island . 

<root> The most popular lodging is actually camping on the beaches . 

<root> There are several campsites that allow tourists to barbeque on the beach with beautiful mountain views in the background . 

<root> Tourists can choose to purchase camping tour packages which include a driver or guide that will show tourists around the beaches as well as provide meals during their stay . 

<root> It is a fantastic way to enjoy the beauty and wildlife of the island . 

<root> A runway that provides fairly regular airline transportation was only constructed in 1999 . 

<root> Like everything else , infrastructure and transportation has only just begun in recent years . 

<root> There are also plans for new harbor facilities that will allow fisherman to sell and catch more easily and make importing food and fuel simpler . 

<root> In addition , there are also two information centers located at the airport and Hadibo . 

<root> When to go : Climate is an important consideration . 

<root> And this depends on your interest . 

<root> Nature enthusiasts should go from early October to late April . 

<root> The monsoon occurs in July till mid-August ( during July in the south east and south west of the island , wind surfing activity can be arranged ) . 

<root> Generally , wildlife and natural viewing is best from the end of January through May .

<root> Socotra is considered the jewel of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea . 

<root> Although the region is small , it is characterized by unique land and marine biodiversity . 

<root> The interior of the island is dominated by the beautiful and green Hagghier mountains and limestone plateau . 

<root> While on the outer coastline , breathtaking natural beaches have pure white sand dunes and palm trees . 

<root> Socotra Island is very rich and is home to many rare spectacular species of reefs , fish , birds , plants , and trees which are not found anywhere else in the world . 

<root> The limestone plateau and the Hagghier Mountains are the richest areas for endemic plant species , but endemics are found throughout the island in every type of vegetation . 

<root> One of the most famous plants is the dragon 's blood tree “ dracaena cinnabara ” which exists only on Socotra and nowhere else on the Earth . 

<root> The tree got its name because if any damage is made to the bark then a dark red liquid oozes out . 

<root> The dragon 's blood tree thrives in Socotra 's arid climate 

<root> There is also the Desert Rose ( adenium obesium ) which looks like a blooming elephant leg . 

<root> Also found in Socotra 's landscape is the ever-strange and extremely rare Cucumber Tree . 

<root> In addition there are over 120 species of birds and about 190 species of butterflies . 

<root> There is so much beauty all around the island , it is difficult not the appreciate to magnificent scenery and wildlife . 

<root> Tulsa 

<root> Tulsa is in the Green Country region of Oklahoma . 

<root> It is also called “ T-town ” by the locals and has been called the " Oil Capital of the World " . 

<root> The city had about 391,000 people and the metro area had about 937,000 people as of 2010 from the US Census Bureau . 

<root> The Tulsa Bartlesville Combined area had 988,000 in the 2010 census . 

<root> Understand 

<root> Tulsa lies in northeastern Oklahoma , at the convergence of the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau , and receives an average of 40 inches of precipitation each year , both of which account for its abundant beautiful rolling green terrain . 

<root> As a result , Tulsa breaks the Oklahoma stereotype of being nothing but a flat , arid dust bowl . 

<root> Summers can be very warm and with the cold wind across the plains it can get very cold in the winter , but it does not last long . 

<root> The winters are considered to be very mild . 

<root> There is not much snow , just a few inches each year , typically , although in 2007 and again in 2008 there were rather large " ice storms " . 

<root> Tulsa has over 225 days of sunshine annually . 

<root> In Tulsa you will find old west charm as well as a cosmopolitan atmosphere . 

<root> You will find the people of Tulsa love their city and they have that southern charm , so they are willing to help you find your way around . 

<root> Tulsa has one of the largest concentrations of Art Deco in the nation , having been a booming city during the 1920s when the architecture was first built by rich oil barons who built stately mansions and turned the Downtown area into a treasure trove of art .

<root> Tulsa International Airport ( IATA : TUL ) in the northern part of Tulsa . 

<root> It has major airlines with direct flights to major cities in the U.S. 

<root> It is a small but nice airport with sofas and chairs all around and a very laid-back feel . 

<root> The car rental area and parking is well integrated . 

<root> The airport offers free short term parking ( first half-hour free ) . 

<root> Richard L. Jones , Jr. Airport ( IATA : RVS ) ( often called the " Riverside Airport " ) is south of downtown and is a general aviation airport . 

<root> By train 

<root> There is no passenger train service to Tulsa . 

<root> By car 

<root> Most Tulsans drive almost everywhere , although bus , bike , and pedestrian routes are starting to catch on .

<root> Thanks to urban planning , the major city streets are placed in a grid layout . 

<root> Almost all major intersections are one mile from each other , and exactly in a straight line . 

<root> That makes it much easier to find places than in cities where streets go every which way . 

<root> The major exception is downtown , which is slanted at almost a 45 degree angle to the rest of the grid . 

<root> By car 

<root> Several freeways and bypasses can be used to easily get around the Tulsa Metro area : I-244 , I-44 , US 169 ( Mingo Valley Expressway , aka " Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway " ) , US 75 , Hwy 51 ( Broken Arrow Expressway , The " B.A. " ) , Creek Turnpike . 

<root> The streets and avenues are planned on a 1 mile by 1 mile grid system , with the main arterials running on each mile . 

<root> In the core of the city , named avenues run north / south and are named after US cities , generally in repeating alphabetical order ( for example , Winston - Yale - Allegheny - Braden ) . 

<root> In the mid-town area the names are taken from colleges and college towns . 

<root> North / South is divided by Admiral Blvd . 

<root> Name streets East of Main are cities east of the Mississippi River , vice versa for name streets west of Main . 

<root> In the parts of the city farther from downtown , north-south streets are numbered . 

<root> It is important to recognize that the specific format of the north-south numbered street names is North / South 145th East / West Avenue . 

<root> Numbered streets run East / West with Main Street and the Arkansas River as the dividing line . 

<root> Watch out for Place , Street , Avenue designation , e.g. 47th Place , 47th Street , or Florence Place , Florence Avenue . 

<root> It is important to recognize that the specific format of the east-west numbered street names is West / East 71st Street North / South . 

<root> In some parts of the city , numbered streets intersect , so the distinction is important . 

<root> Although rare , one east-west numbered street may even intersect with a street of the same number running north-south . 

<root> Downtown streets were originally platted parallel to the Frisco railroad tracks . 

<root> When Tulsa expanded beyond the bounds of its original plat , the expanded areas were platted in alignment with the points of the compass . 

<root> Thus the " twisted " area down-town represents the original extent of Tulsa ca 1907 . 

<root> By bus 

<root> Tulsa Transit provides bus service for the Tulsa Metro area . 

<root> Cities served are Tulsa , Sand Springs , Sapulpa , Jenks , and Broken Arrow . 

<root> The central station is at 319 S. Denver ( downtown ) . 

<root> They do not run that often , especially to the outer towns like Broken Arrow . 

<root> Unlike major cities in the Northeast , the city bus is not a major form of transportation in the city . 

<root> It is usually a means of travel for those who are without their own motor vehicle . 

<root> By bicycle 

<root> Tulsa has an extensive interconnected paved bike trail system . 

<root> Rivertrail follows the Arkansas River from downtown Tulsa south to the suburbs . 

<root> The Katy Trail runs west to Sand Springs . 

<root> The Osage Trail is a rails-to-trails route that begins at the OSU-Tulsa campus and travels north 15 miles to Skiatook . 

<root> The Creek Trail connects Rivertrail and continues east through Broken Arrow to the NSU-Broken Arrow campus . 

<root> Riders accustomed to flat terrain may find Tulsa 's rolling land to be a bit more challenging , particularly during the heat of summer . 

<root> If you are looking for a good workout , the Creek Turnpike Trail follows the land 's original contours . 

<root> Rivertrail is probably be best choice for the rider seeking an easy route . 

<root> Four bike loan depots , located along Rivertrail , allow riders to borrow a bike for free for up to twenty-four hours . 

<root> Tulsa has an active bicycling community . 

<root> York 

<root> York is an ancient cathedral city with a history that dates back to before Roman times . 

<root> It is situated in Yorkshire , North Yorkshire , England with some of the best preserved historical buildings and structures in Europe . 

<root> As of the 2001 census , the population of York was 181,000 . 

<root> York is frequently ranked ( often vying with Manchester ) the second most visited city in England after London . 

<root> York Minster 

<root> Understand 

<root> York was known as Eboracum by the Romans , who founded the fortress city on the River Ouse in the year 71 . 

<root> York was home first to the Ninth Legion and later the Sixth . 

<root> York quickly became one of the most important cities in Roman Britain , and after 211 became the capital of the province Britannia Inferior . 

<root> Constantine the Great - later responsible for making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire - was first proclaimed Emperor in the city . 

<root> Captured by the Vikings 866 , the city quickly took on a new identity as Jorvik ( pronounced " Yor-vik " ) and experienced a major urban revival as a centre of Viking trade and settlement in northern England . 

<root> The Coppergate excavations of the 1970s revealed much of this Viking past . 

<root> York is a fairly small city - four days is enough to see the major sights although York is a city that reveals its charms to explorers with curiosity and patience . 

<root> York is known as England 's " City of Festivals " as there are regular cultural festivals every year . 

<root> The official festivals are the Viking Festival , the Festival of Angels , Early Music , Late Music , Horse Racing ( the " Ebor Race Meeting " ) , Multicultural Food and Arts , Chinese New Year , Mystery Plays , Christmas St Nicholas ' Fair , and the Food and Drink Festival . 

<root> It 's a romantic city for a weekend break . 

<root> York is full of magic and a wonderful place to bring children ! 

<root> Get in 

<root> Most travellers will arrive in York by road ( car or bus ) or rail from other parts of the UK or an airport . 

<root> By car 

<root> Although York is not directly on any of the main north-south motorways , the connections are reasonably good . 

<root> From the south , the quickest route is probably to take the M1 northbound to junction 32 , then the M18 eastbound to junction 2 , the A1M northbound to junction 44 and finally the A64 eastbound to the York Outer Ring Road ( A1237 ) . 

<root> Alternatively , you can take the M1 all the way to the A64 , but the upper reaches of the M1 around Sheffield and Leeds can get very congested , especially in the rush hours . 

<root> From the west , the A59 and the M62 provide connections from Liverpool and Manchester , and from the north the A1 and the A19 link York with Tyneside , Northumberland and south-eastern Scotland . 

<root> Driving into the city centre itself is something to avoid . 

<root> Traffic congestion on the main arterial roads serving the city ( especially the A19 on Bootham and the Inner Ring Road ) can get very bad , especially during the rush hours and on Saturday mornings . 

<root> The remodelling of some roads near bottleneck junctions to accommodate bicycle lanes has made traffic jams even worse still in recent years , and parking in the city centre is very expensive . 

<root> If you are just visiting York for the day , using a Park and Ride [ 1 ] costs a lot less than trying to park in or near the city centre , and there are five sites dotted around the Outer Ring Road . 

<root> However , the last buses from the city centre leave at around 8 pm in the evenings and you are not allowed to leave your car in a Park and Ride overnight . 

<root> Therefore , if you are staying overnight in York and arriving by car , make sure that your hotel offers parking before you book . 

<root> If you are only visiting for the day but staying until late evening , you will need to use a city centre car park . 

<root> How to Detect Arrogant People 

<root> Do you always seem to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves , intolerant of people different from them , rude or downright arrogant ? 

<root> These people can be a great source of potential pain , and this article is here to help you sort the arrogant from the not-so-arrogant . 

<root> Steps 

<root> Pay attention to their conversations . 

<root> Do n't eavesdrop , but when they 're talking to you or to those around you , listen to them . 

<root> Is it always about them ? 

<root> Do they get mad or irritated if the centre of attention moves to someone else ? 

<root> These are good signs of arrogance . 

<root> Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience , and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience " have got something over them " . 

<root> Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning ( actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability ) , arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited , narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others . 

<root> Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own / have that you do n't . 

<root> Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good . 

<root> When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you . 

<root> This happens when you question ( or at least seem to question ) their appearance , intelligence , athletic abilities , or anything else relating to their self-image . 

<root> Challenge their worldview . 

<root> Do n't be aggressive –– just skeptical and curious . 

<root> If they get upset , gauge their anger . 

<root> If it 's minimal , they may be simply having a bad day . 

<root> But if they 're enraged , then they may see you as questioning their ' perfect little world . ' 

<root> And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance . 

<root> At some point or another , most people realize that the world does n't revolve around them . 

<root> Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them , and get angry if they 're reminded of the real world . 

<root> Ambiguity frightens arrogant people because it suggests imperfection , change and lack of certainty ( realities we all must contend with as best we can ) . 

<root> As such , instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one 's preferences , the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone , which of course , is an impossible mission . 

<root> Reality hurts when it intrudes ; as such , an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyse , thereby not seeing their own imperfections . 

<root> They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances . 

<root> Learn the quality of their friendships . 

<root> Do n't be nosy or gossipy , but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next , that 's a sign of them having a lot of fair weather friends . 

<root> That 's a sign of arrogance , since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who 's stuck on themselves . 

<root> Prideful people have a strong need to look good , and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that . 

<root> Since being a good friend to someone usually means helping them , they often ca n't stand the thought of a good friendship . 

<root> Ironically , arrogant people often ca n't understand why they do n't have any reliable and supportive friends . 

<root> How do they treat those not like themselves ? 

<root> In other words , how do they treat those with different beliefs , cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world ? 

<root> If it 's inherently negative , then they 're either over-zealous , ignorant of other people or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only . 

<root> Determine this based on their general personality and the people they 're interacting with . 

<root> Many times prideful people have a serious ' my-way's-the-only-way ' attitude . 

<root> This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land . 

<root> What 's their personality like ? 

<root> Take note of how they act , talk , and use their social status . 

<root> Do they have a general sense of ' coolness ? ' 

<root> Are they a chatterbox ? 

<root> Do they act like they own the place , or act like the ' big dog ? ' 

<root> Are they very keen on their self-image ? 

<root> Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through . 

<root> But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they do n't like . 

<root> When they are cruel , their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it since they 're afraid that they 'll be treated badly by their ' friend . ' 

<root> Mention people you know that they do n't like . 

<root> This is n't meant to begin a conflict , but to gauge their rivalries , annoyances and enmities . 

<root> If their condemnation seems to be reasonable , they probably are n't hubristic . 

<root> If it 's harsh , they are . 

<root> For the most part , arrogant people see people that they do n't like as threats to their perfect little world . 

<root> The more they hate someone , the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land . 

<root> And in turn , the bigger the threat , the harsher the criticism . 

<root> Ask around to see what they 've been saying about you . 

<root> If they have been saying bad things about you , they may simply not like you . 

<root> If they 're nice to your face , but talk bad about you behind your back like it 's their favourite hobby , then they probably have a problem with pride . 

<root> Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they do n't have any good friends . 

<root> They compensate for this by creating the impression that they have a lot of friends - they have a ' quantity , not quality ' mentality . 

<root> Then they simply insult their trophy friends when they are n't looking . 

<root> How to Ballet Dance 

<root> Ballet began in royal courts in the early 1600's , and early forms of this elegant and sophisticated art involved long skirts and wooden clogs . 

<root> Dancing ballet is extremely popular throughout the world , and studying ballet can help develop strong bodies , spatial and temporal awareness , and improve coordination . 

<root> People who study ballet also retain flexibility throughout their adult lives , making this technique the basis of training for all types of dance . 

<root> While dancing ballet takes dedication and requires serious training , you can learn the basics to prepare yourself for further study . 

<root> Learn to get ready for practicing , the basic positions , and some of the first techniques you 're likely to encounter in ballet . 

<root> Part 1 Getting Ready to Dance 

<root> Stretch your muscles thoroughly . 

<root> Stretching is important to loosen muscles , strengthen muscles and to elongate your posture . 

<root> It is vital that it is done at the beginning of each ballet session , including before a performance . 

<root> When taking on ballet , it is important to stretch daily for at least 15 - 30 minutes , to give the muscles ample opportunity to warm up , reducing the risk of injury . 

<root> You should also stretch to " wind down " at the end of ballet dancing . 

<root> Always wear ballet slippers . 

<root> Properly-fitted ballet shoes should be snug , but not so tight they cut off blood flow and create numbness in the feet . 

<root> There are different styles and types of shoes , so ask your ballet teacher or a salesman at the store for advice , given your intentions for dancing . 

<root> Do n't buy shoes to grow into , because your feet will seem flexed when you pointe and will look flat . 

<root> You should fit them to where the drawstring is tied slightly loose . 

<root> If your drawstring is longer than your pinkie then you should cut it off till it is roughly the size of your fingernail . 

<root> The drawstring just completes the fit . 

<root> It is n't made to tighten overly large shoes . 

<root> If you ca n't buy ballet shoes , that it is okay . 

<root> Use socks without the stickies on the bottom , so you can turn ! 

<root> Wear comfortable and snug-fitting athletic clothes . 

<root> The most important thing is that you are comfortable , and that you 're not wearing baggy or loose fitting clothing so you can make sure you 're forming and moving correctly in the mirror . 

<root> A plain black leotard and pink tights are usually a safe bet . 

<root> Pink or black ballet slippers are also appropriate . 

<root> If you 're signed up for a class , check with your instructor to find out if there is a dress code at the school . 

<root> Some schools may have students wear the same thing and others may just require any type of leotard and tights and sometimes ballet skirts . 

<root> Mostly they require tight fitting clothing so they can see that your muscles are working properly and so on . 

<root> Find an appropriate space to practice . 

<root> Ballet is less about learning the moves and more about perfecting them . 

<root> The moves themselves are relatively straightforward , but the positing , the timing , and the elegance required takes a lifetime of practice . 

<root> For this reason , it 's always better to practice ballet in a ballet studio under the guidance of a good instructor , who will be able to correct your positioning and make sure that you 're dancing properly . 

<root> A dancing studio is equipped with mirrors for correcting your positioning and seeing what you 're doing accurately , and a barre for practicing . [ 1 ] 

<root> If you want to practice at home , make sure you 've got enough open space to move freely , preferably on a hard wood floor . 

<root> The back of a chair can replace the need for a bar . 

<root> Position a large mirror so you can check your positioning and see what you 're doing . 

<root> How to Grow Basil 

<root> Three Methods : Starting Seeds Caring for Basil Harvesting and Using Basil 

<root> Basil is easy to grow , and transforms ordinary meals into culinary treasures ! 

<root> Fresh basil not only tastes better than dried , it actually tastes different , almost as if it were not the same herb . 

<root> This article outlines how to plant and harvest basil . 

<root> Method 1 of 3 : Starting Seeds 

<root> 1 Choose the kind of basil you wish to grow . 

<root> Basil comes in many different varieties , each of which have a unique flavor and smell . 

<root> Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you , then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store . 

<root> Here are a few ideas : 

<root> Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice , and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers . 

<root> Lemon basil actually contains citral , an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit , and smells very lemony . 

<root> Purple basil is often grown for decoration , as well as its scent and flowers . 

<root> There are perennial basils which come back year after year , like African Blue Basil ( which has pretty blue veins on its leaves ) and Thai Basil , while most other varieties are annuals , which you 'll have to plant year after year . 

<root> Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow , but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained . 

<root> 2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost . 

<root> Basil needs warm air and sun to do well , so it 's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they 'll get damaged by frost . 

<root> If you live in a hot climate , you can start the seeds outside instead . 

<root> To figure out when the last frost will be , consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area . 

<root> 3 Prepare seed containers . 

<root> Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite , vermiculite , and peat . 

<root> Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets . 

<root> Dampen the mixture with water so it 's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate . 

<root> 4 Plant the seeds . 

<root> Drop one to two seeds into each container . 

<root> Cover them lightly with soil . 

<root> Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap , so they stay moist . 

<root> Leave the containers in a sunny window . 

<root> Twice daily , remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water . 

<root> 5 Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge . 

<root> When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil , it 's time to remove the plastic wrap . 

<root> Keep watering the sprouts twice daily , never letting the soil dry out . 

<root> When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature , it 's time to transplant them to a larger container . 

<root> Method 2 of 3 : Caring for Basil 

<root> 1 Transplant the basil plants . 

<root> Once two sets of leaves have formed , basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers . 

<root> Basil does not tolerate frost so do n't plant too early . 

<root> It 's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil . 

<root> To plant the basil in the garden , dig holes spaced at least 6 inches apart . 

<root> Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems . 

<root> Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets . 

<root> If you want to plant the basil in a container , make sure it 's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you 're growing ; 

<root> they need to be planted 6 inches apart , since they grow quite large . 

<root> 2 Keep the soil damp , but not soaked . 

<root> Basil does best in well-drained soil , and should not be subjected to standing water . 

<root> Water the mature basil plants once a day , in the morning , so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight . 

<root> 3 Pinch off flower heads . 

<root> When you see flower buds , pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off . 

<root> Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves , as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows . 

<root> This is called " bolting " and is more likely to happen when there 's extra sunshine . 

<root> You 'll notice that if you leave the flowers , the plant will become lanky and the leaves wo n't be as full or tasty . 

<root> 4 Watch for pests and mold . 

<root> Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles 

<root> the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand . 

<root> If your plants show signs of mold growth , they may not be getting adequate sunlight , or they may be too close together . 

<root> Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space . 

<root> Method 3 of 3 : Harvesting and Using Basil 

<root> 1 Harvest and prune . 

<root> As the plant matures , pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height . 

<root> If you look closely , at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off . 

<root> Cut close to those tiny leaves , but be sure not to damage them . 

<root> Pinching encourages the plant 's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves . 

<root> This helps the plants grow bushy . 

<root> Do n't pinch on the lower part of the stem , or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy . 

<root> You want them to get bushy , so pinch from the top . 

<root> 2 Enjoy the basil fresh . 

<root> Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese . 

<root> 3 Store the basil in the refrigerator . 

<root> You 'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh , so plan on storing some in the fridge . 

<root> Wash the leaves , dry them well , and wrap them in paper towels . 

<root> Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid . 

<root> 4 Freeze the basil . 

<root> Freezing the leaves whole does n't work very well , but if you puree it first you can freeze it for months . 

<root> Place the basil in a blender with a little water . 

<root> Puree it until smooth , then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it . 

<root> How to Hypnotize a Chicken 

<root> Anyone who 's spent a lot of time on a farm with chickens is probably familiar with this trick . 

<root> Those who 've never heard of this will be amazed to see a chicken lie perfectly still after these instructions are followed . 

<root> Biologists think that fear causes this " hypnosis , " which may be an attempt to " play dead " to fool predators . 

<root> Method One of Two : Hypnotizing a Chicken 

<root> Hold the chicken down on a flat surface . 

<root> Hold the chicken with one hand supporting the breast . 

<root> Place it down so that its breast is carrying its weight and rests on the ground . 

<root> Continue to hold its feet so the grand experiment can continue . 

<root> You can place the chicken on its breast instead . 

<root> Press gently down on its back , and gently move its legs back if it tries to stand up . 

<root> Wiggle your finger . 

<root> Hold the bird down gently with one hand . 

<root> Put one finger on your other hand just in front of its beak tip , without touching it . 

<root> Move the finger backward to about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) away , then back again . 

<root> Repeat until the chicken stops moving or squawking . 

<root> Let go of its legs . 

<root> The chicken should be " hypnotized " and cease to struggle . 

<root> It will lie there for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes . 

<root> Draw a line in front of its beak instead . 

<root> If the chicken was n't hypnotized , try this alternative . 

<root> Using chalk , a stick , or your finger , draw a line on the ground 12 " ( 30 cm ) long . 

<root> Start near the chicken 's beak and draw the line slowly outward , in front of its head . 

<root> Wake it up by clapping . 

<root> Be nice to your feathered friend and let it get back to its business . 

<root> Clap your hands or give it a gentle shove until it jumps up and walks away . 

<root> Method Two of Two : Reducing Stress in the Chicken 

<root> Understand the hypnotic effect . 

<root> Researchers call this effect " tonic immobility " . 

<root> " When a chicken or another animal with this tendency becomes frightened , its heart rate lowers and it stops moving . 

<root> This may be an attempt to play dead , discouraging predators that prefer live prey . 

<root> Unlike an opossum , the chicken gives an unconvincing act , as it continues to blink and breathe in an obvious way . " 

<root> Keep the chicken upright or on its side . 

<root> While it 's not uncommon to transport a chicken by its feet , this upside-down hold risks breaking the chicken 's hip . 

<root> Hypnosis techniques that involve laying a chicken on its back may " succeed " by cutting off its air supply . 

<root> This can cause the chicken significant discomfort , leading to fainting or even , rarely , death . 

<root> Keep hypnosis short and infrequent . 

<root> It 's not completely clear how much stress this hypnosis causes . 

<root> Even if it does , the chicken should n't suffer as long as you let it go soon afterward . 

<root> Hours of stress , or regular exposure to stressful situations , can cause serious health problems . 

<root> Get your chickens used to humans and novelty . 

<root> Even prolonged eye contact seems to have an effect . 

<root> Living in stimulating environments with new objects may also help . 

<root> Hens raise in battery cages stay " hypnotized " longer , possibly because of greater fear . 

<root> Watch for signs of stress . 

<root> Abnormal feathering , constant preening , or delays in egg-laying are all signs of a stressed chicken . 

<root> While hypnotizing is unlikely to cause serious harm , any type of stress is more damaging to a chicken in this state . 

<root> How to Annoy People in Elevators 

<root> An elevator is almost the perfect environment to be a prankster . 

<root> It ’s easy to annoy people when you are cramped in such a small , tight space . 

<root> Because elevator rides usually last less than a minute , make sure your pranks are quick and have a lot of punch . 

<root> When annoying people on an elevator , keep your pranks lighthearted and fun as opposed to mean-spirited so that everyone leaving the elevator will have a pleasant story to tell . 

<root> Method 1 Using the Elevator to Annoy People 

<root> Push all the buttons . 

<root> When you get into the elevator , push the button for every floor . 

<root> This makes everyone ’s ride on the elevator longer , if only for a few seconds . 

<root> If you want to take it a step further , look around questioningly at everyone in the elevator when no one gets off at the floors you pushed . [ 1 ] 

<root> When someone comes in , say , " I 've got this , " before you push all of the buttons . 

<root> You can also push all the buttons as you reach the floor you are getting off at . 

<root> If someone asks you why you pushed all the buttons , you can honestly say , " It was just a joke ! " 

<root> Make a dinging noise at each floor . 

<root> Every time the elevator reaches a new floor , say “ ding ! ” very loudly . 

<root> You can even sing the word “ ding ” on each floor like notes in a scale , getting higher as you reach each new floor . [ 2 ] 

<root> You can make other noises if you prefer , such as a bird cawing or an explosion sound every time a button is pushed . 

<root> Talk to your reflection in the mirror . 

<root> Many elevators have mirrors on the walls . 

<root> A great way to be mischievous in an elevator is to carry on a running commentary while you look at yourself in the mirror . 

<root> You could look at yourself , turning to catch different angles and say “ All right , all right , now we ’re talking , ” very loudly . 

<root> You could also keep adjusting your shirt or your hair , keeping a running dialogue about what look is best for you . 

<root> Stand in the corner of the elevator facing the wall . 

<root> Do n't say anything the whole ride . 

<root> Dance to the elevator music . 

<root> Many elevators play music in the background , usually soft rock or smooth jazz . 

<root> If you ’re in an elevator that is playing music , start to dance . 

<root> Start just bobbing your head and tapping your feet , and then get your whole body into it . 

<root> Take up as much space as you can to dance until everyone is staring at you . [ 3 ] 

<root> Announce every floor . 

<root> At every floor , make a loud announcement telling everyone the floor number . 

<root> Say something like “ Everyone going to floor ten , get off now ! No time to dilly dally ! ” [ 4 ] 

<root> You can also pretend to conduct people onto the elevator , saying “ All aboard the elevator train ! ” 

<root> Exclaim that you 've lost a beast . 

<root> When the elevator is going from the bottom floor to the top , as soon as the doors close , exclaim that you lost your tarantula / snake / scorpion but confirm that it is somewhere in the elevator . 

<root> Most people will probably see that this is a joke . 

<root> However , if somebody looks seriously alarmed or is starting to panic , let them know that you were not being serious . 

<root> Build in or add something to the elevator . 

<root> For example , build a Lego city in the middle of the elevator . 

<root> Lay a Twister mat on the floor and ask people if they want to play . 

<root> Talk to people . 

<root> When there are a lot of people , say , " You 're probably wondering why I 've gathered you here today . " 

<root> How to Flirt Through Instant Messaging 

<root> So you want to flirt with a guy or gal on MSN , AIM , Facebook Chat , or any other instant messaging service and you do n't want to look like a creep ? 

<root> Congratulations — by seeking help , you 've already demonstrated more self-awareness than the vast majority of online flirts . 

<root> See Step 1 below to start flirting smartly and respectfully . 

<root> Part 1 of 2 : Flirting Dos 

<root> Start the conversation casually . 

<root> As in the real world , the first step to flirting is to get over your cold feet and jump right in ! 

<root> Text the other person a brief message asking them about their day , asking them a specific question about work or school , or simply saying " Hi ! " . 

<root> The hardest part of flirting is to break through your initial reluctance , so if you 're having a hard time taking the plunge , just remind yourself that no matter how badly it goes , it 'll be less stressful than an equivalent real-world encounter . 

<root> There 's no reason to be nervous when it comes to IM flirting — 

<root> if the person you want to talk to does n't want to talk to you , s/he always has the option of simply not responding to your message , as , from your point of view , this is indistinguishable from him or her simply being away from the computer . 

<root> This being said , if you barely know someone , it can be a good idea to have an excuse for starting a conversation to avoid awkwardness . 

<root> Asking for help with a work or school-related problem is almost always a good bet , as is asking a question about something striking about the person . 

<root> For instance , if the person has a band-related username , you might say : " Hey , cool name . Did you see those guys when they last came to town ? " 

<root> Start small talk . 

<root> After your initial greeting and exchange of pleasantries , you 'll probably want to ask how the person 's doing ( just like you might in the real world ) . 

<root> Ask him or her about work or school , his / her interests , or any recent trips , for instance . 

<root> Rather than asking a question , you can also simply offer your comments on these things . 

<root> When s/he responds , add your own comments or ask follow-up questions and proceed from there ! 

<root> Do n't pry into his or her personal life — keep things light , fun , and focused on worry-free subjects . 

<root> Do n't dwell too long on small talk . 

<root> A minute or two is great for breaking the ice , but much more can get boring fast . 

<root> For example , after we 've opened up by asking about this person 's interest in the band in his / her username , it 's logical and reasonable to ask about this person 's musical likes and dislikes . 

<root> You can even offer your own opinions and suggestions . 

<root> For instance , you might say something like : " If you like those guys , you might want to check out this band called Manic Albatross - they 're like the Beatles , only darker . What sorts of other bands do you like ? " 

<root> Joke . 

<root> Everyone likes a good sense of humor . 

<root> In the immortal words of Marilyn Monroe , " If you can make a woman laugh , you can make her do anything " ( do n't worry , ladies — the same is true for men ! ) 

<root> Try to be playful and even slightly sarcastic as you respond to the statements of the person you 're talking to . 

<root> For instance , if you 're asked what you 're up to , rather than saying , " looking for people to hit on on Facebook " you might find that it 's a better idea to give a sarcastic answer like " writing the great American novel " or " drowning my sorrows " . 

<root> These responses have the added benefit of being natural launching points for conversations about your hobbies , like the writing you 're doing on the side and the great bourbon you tasted the other day . 

<root> In our example conversation , you might work a joke or two into your music-related small talk . 

<root> For instance , you might say something like , " I do n't know why every song on the radio nowadays has a Texas Flynn feature . Does he even have time to record between rehab stints ? " 

<root> Part 2 of 2 : Flirting Don'ts 

<root> Do n't be too self-deprecating . 

<root> Simply put , confidence is sexy . 

<root> This is more true for real-life situations than it is online , but this mantra has some truth in the world of IM flirting as well . 

<root> For instance , you 'll want to avoid making lots of jokes at your own expense . 

<root> Just one is plenty — it should n't be a recurring theme throughout your conversation . 

<root> Doing this too often can quickly turn an otherwise flirtatious conversation into one in which you appear needy and self-loathing . 

<root> On the other hand , this is n't to say that you should necessarily make jokes at other people 's expense , as this can make you seem mean and petty . 

<root> Any sort of pointed or caustic remarks about yourself or someone else do n't have a place in flirtatious conversations . 

<root> Do n't be too sappy . 

<root> People like flirting to be fun . 

<root> For most people , receiving compliments is only fun up to a point — getting more than one or two can make someone feel embarrassed and self-conscious . 

<root> It can also make him or her question your motives , leading the person to believe that you may be trying to get something out of him or her . 

<root> Besides , the wooing power of flowery , gushing compliments is diminished ( to say the least ) when the compliments are displayed in a tiny box at the bottom of the screen alongside cartoon smiley faces . 

<root> Instead of relying too heavily on compliments , instead , focus on having an engaging , genuine conversation . 

<root> Follow the mantra " show , do n't tell . " 

<root> In other words , show that you 're attracted to this person by giving him or her a great conversation , not by stating it outright . 

<root> How to Make a Glowstick 

<root> Those glowing Mountain Dew videos with peroxide and baking soda are all hoaxes . 

<root> To truly make a glowstick without breaking an already-made glowstick and shoving its contents into a tube ( also known as cheating ) , you 've gotta let your inner scientist out ( along with a few dollars ) . 

<root> If you 're still curious , read on . 

<root> This is fun for anyone and everyone . 

<root> Method One of Two : Using Luminol 

<root> Put on protective glasses . 

<root> In addition , wear gloves to protect your skin . 

<root> It 's also a good idea to not wear your Sunday best . 

<root> Throw on some old clothes or put a smock over clothes you want protected . 

<root> Some of this stuff is dangerous -- this experiment is not meant for children ! 

<root> Listen up , kids : You 'll be working with a solution that 's near a 12 on the pH scale . 

<root> That basically means do n't swallow it , do n't put it in your eyes , do n't bathe in it , and do n't really expose yourself to it directly at all . 

<root> Got it ? 

<root> Moving on . 

<root> Combine 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide and a liter of distilled water in a mixing bowl . 

<root> A ceramic bowl will work best , but plastic works too . 

<root> Use funnels , measuring tubes , and basters to keep everything well-measured and well away from you . 

<root> Hydrogen peroxide is used to replace the luminol 's nitrogen atoms with oxygen . 

<root> When that happens , all the substances create a rave and start partying and electrons fly everywhere and what results ? 

<root> The glow . 

<root> Mix .2 grams of luminol , 4 grams of sodium carbonate , .4 grams of copper sulfate , .5 grams of ammonium carbonate and 1 liter ( 0.3 US gal ) of distilled water in a second bowl . 

<root> It is important not to touch the luminol . 

<root> Use a funnel to make everything safe and easy . 

<root> Unfortunately , these hazardous chemicals will not float freely in mid-air like this graphic suggests . 

<root> Yep , unless you 're a coroner or some sort of crazy spy / criminologist you probably do n't have this stuff lying around the house ( hopefully not ... ) . 

<root> If you 're dead set on starting your own glowstick business ( worse ideas exist ) , try websites like Alfa Aesar [ 1 ] or Sigma Aldrich [ 2 ] for supplies . 

<root> Mix everything well . 

<root> Do n't use your hands -- use a metal or plastic utensil of some sort . 

<root> Clean the containers and dry them thoroughly . 

<root> It 's important to use sanitary , clean tubes for your glowsticks . 

<root> The last thing you want is other substances interacting with the reactions you 're depending on to make the substances glow . 

<root> Set the correct lid next to each container . 

<root> This enables you to seal the containers quickly after filling . 

<root> It 's not like the glow will get up and run away from you , but still . 

<root> Combine equal amounts of the first and second solution in the container and close the bottles . 

<root> Shake them up once the lids are on tightly . 

<root> Then turn off the lights ! 

<root> If it 's not already glowing , something went wrong . 

<root> Do over ! 

<root> Watch as the chemical compound creates a colorful glow . 

<root> Take your glowsticks to the party and charge your friends loads of money for them ! 

<root> But act quickly ... 

<root> the glow wo n't last very long . 

<root> Expectations crushed ? 

<root> Method two to the rescue ! 

<root> The reaction that the luminol and hydrogen peroxide creates does n't last long at all -- maybe a couple of minutes . 

<root> For something that lasts hours , go to the next method ( which is a lot easier to facilitate if you have access to a laboratory , but it 's still worth mentioning ) . 

<root> Method 2 of 2 : Using Grammar 

<root> Name your language . 

<root> This is the most fundamental property in all languages . 

<root> You have many names to choose from . 

<root> You can even use a made up word from your made up language like ' Victory ' or ' Great Language ' . 

<root> The choice is all yours . 

<root> Start off with the highly frequently used words such as ' and ' or ' I ' or ' one ' or ' the ' . 

<root> It is recommend that you use short words since they are commonly used . 

<root> An example would be ' ant ' for and or ' es ' or even ' loo ' for the word ' and ' . 

<root> Start thinking about the grammar rules . 

<root> For example if the word Bird is ' Vogelaviatiolap ' then why not make the word Birds ' Vogelaviatiolaps ' since the suffix ' s ' is added at the end for most languages at plurals . 

<root> If you want to add complication , you can add genders like most European languages like French and German . 

<root> For example , if you want the word ' horse ' to be a boy , you may want ' the horse ' to be ' Mat Fereder ' , but a ' cat ' to be a girl , you may want , ' the cat ' to be ' Fet Kamaow ' . 

<root> Consider basing your language on an existing language . 

<root> For example , in my made up language , ' Vogelaviatiolap ' means Bird . 

<root> If you have n't guessed , it comes from the following : 

<root> ' Vogel ' comes from German , which means bird 

<root> ' aviatio ' comes from English . 

<root> It 's uncompleted though , because the word is part of the term ' aviation ' 

<root> ' lap ' comes from Onomatopoeia . 

<root> It 's a completed term , but it is supposed to come from ' Flap ! ' 

<root> Consider basing some of your words from other words you have invented . 

<root> For example , if you invented the word ' China ' as ' Khinssa ' , ' Drink ' as ' Bever ' , and the word ' Accident ' as ' Casnondelibreaten ' , why not make the word ' tea ' as ' Khincasnonbever ' or ' Bevernondelibreatekin ' or even ' Khinssacasnondelibreatenibever ' ! 

<root> Get inspiration from existing alphabets and words . 

<root> Why not add some non Latin Characters such as ß ? 

<root> You can even make the whole language not based on the Latin Alphabet at all like Chinese ! 

<root> You can even take some words of languages , altering them or not . 

<root> You can make the word ' pen ' as ' penn ' or even ' pen ' . 

<root> Using the dictionary can ensure you not missing a single word . 

<root> Keep track of all your 

<root> Remember to write down your creations ! 

<root> Use your language . 

<root> Get used to using it yourself , and spread it to others . 

<root> Once you feel confident about your language , experiment and expand : 

<root> Grab a book / novel and translate it to your own language . 

<root> Teach your friends this new language . 

<root> As soon as your friends understand your language , communicate to them with it . 

<root> Be fluent in your own made up language and start spreading this to your friends , family and strangers ! 

<root> Write your own poem / novel / story with your own made up language . 

<root> If you 're really ambitious , set a goal of helping others become fluent in the language . 

<root> One day , maybe you can make it the official language of a country ! 

<root> Tips 

<root> Make sure that it is a language that while speaking , you do n't get a literal knot in your tongue ! 

<root> Remember you should know how to write it . 

<root> For example we write it from left to right , in Arabic it 's right to left , Chinese is in columns , and so on . 

<root> Make sure that you and your friend(s) all follow a systematic language system . 

<root> In other words , make sure that you follow the same guidelines . 

<root> Do n't use random letters . 

<root> It should make some sense , so that it will be easier to learn and speak with [ Example : Do n't use oh as e , hello as llo , and See ya as c yah ) . 

<root> Make sure you practice saying and spelling out many basic words in your language , English examples : is , who , when , of , why , if , what , where , can , may , etc . 

<root> When starting off , follow closely to a language you like . 

<root> This will make grammar much easier to make . 

<root> You must avoid simply copying the grammar rules , however , as this would technically turn your language into a code . 

<root> Practice your language frequently so that you do n't forget it ! 

<root> Do n't forget punctuation ! 

<root> As a shortcut , and for a bit of interesting background , add connotation to various letters , preferably vowels . 

<root> To do this , think of various words that begin with / have a lot of a certain vowel . 

<root> For example : austere , acrimony , ebullient , embolden ; in this case , the vowel A might carry with it a negative meaning , whereas E would be positive . 

<root> Then , even if you forget your own words without the help of your dictionary , you could still make a good guess based on the composition of the letters . 

<root> Try not to make your words sound like utter and complete gibberish just add a little extra than our regular English language . 

<root> We do n't want a knot in your tongue after speaking to your friends . 

<root> Just put marks over the letters or make up something right on the spot , you might have to take some time on this ! 

<root> Basing letters on objects ( pictographs ) is an easy way to start a writing system . 

<root> Try this with a group of friends . 

<root> It 's much more fun when there are other people that can understand your language . 

<root> Email or text your friends the language so that they wo n't be so confused . 

<root> When making a writing system , take a break about every five minutes and come back to it or all your letters will begin to look identical . 

<root> If you want to make other languages , you can use this language as a model and change some letters or sounds to create a different language . 

<root> This makes your first language a proto-language — a language that branches off into a family of languages . 

<root> How to Pack Your Possessions When Moving 

<root> Even if you ca n't wait to live in your new house , curb your enthusiasm and resist the urge to cram all your possessions any which way into boxes . 

<root> Steps 

<root> Pack one room at a time if possible , and start with items that are least often used . 

<root> Write down a list of everything you are packing , in particular if it 's valuable . 

<root> Books , CDs , expensive clothes . 

<root> Also , take note of which item is in which box . 

<root> Use sturdy boxes . 

<root> Fill the box to the brim and seal the lid . 

<root> That way , you can easily stack boxes on top of one another . 

<root> Tape the bottom of the box securely so that it does n't give way . 

<root> Never fill a box until it is so heavy that you ca n't lift it safely . 

<root> Spread the heavy items over a few boxes . 

<root> Balance boxes with lighter items like towels or soft toys . 

<root> Pack the lighter items on top . 

<root> Use bubble wrap or newspapers when packing fragile items . 

<root> However , newsprint may smudge so use newspaper selectively . 

<root> Clean paper can be purchased cheaply from moving supply stores . 

<root> Mark boxes . 

<root> Boxes should be marked " Fragile " and " This side up " to prevent mishandling . 

<root> Label each box clearly and which room it belongs to . 

<root> Write on the sides of the box as well . 

<root> Pack a separate box of essentials you may need for the first night at your new house . 

<root> Include items like toiletries , toilet paper , bottled water , snacks and a change of clothes in case you can not unpack everything in time . 

<root> Tips 

<root> Do n't label boxes with contents if the contents are valuable . 

<root> Instead of writing " Silver Service - Fragile " you should write something that makes it sound less theft inviting while showing the fragile nature of the contents . 

<root> Example : " Mom 's old dishes " instead of " Fine China " 

<root> Tape is cheap . 

<root> Use lots of it .

<root> How to Cope With a Double Parachute Failure 

<root> While skydiving , it is possible ( yet extremely unlikely ) that both your primary and reserve parachutes will malfunction , leaving you with no method of reducing your velocity . 

<root> In the vast majority of cases , this will not occur ; 

<root> nevertheless , in this event these coping strategies may assist . 

<root> Steps 

<root> Remain calm . 

<root> This may seem obvious , but deep , even breathing ( despite the rushing slipstream ) and controlling your heart-rate are essential to your continued survival . 

<root> Entreat assistance . 

<root> If both your primary and reserve chutes have malfunctioned , signal immediately to a fellow jumper who has not yet deployed their chute , waving your arms and signalling that your own is not functional . 

<root> If this is a solo jump , then skip to step 6 . 

<root> Prepare for deployment . 

<root> After linking arms with your fellow jumper , you will need to hook your arms through their chest strap , or through both sides of the front of their harness , as far as you can , then grab onto your own strap . 

<root> Deploy . 

<root> The shock of the chute deployment will be intense . 

<root> The G-forces will multiply your body weight , making it impossible to hold on ; 

<root> this is why hooking your arms through the harness is essential . 

<root> It is likely that the shock will dislocate or break both your arms ; 

<root> nevertheless this is a small price to pay for your life . 

<root> Prepare for impact . 

<root> If your companion 's canopy has successfully opened , then both your chances of survival have dramatically increased . 

<root> With a large and slow canopy , your chances are even better . 

<root> The canopy must be steered away from power lines and similar obstructions ; 

<root> try for a large body of water if you are confident your companion can save you from drowning . 

<root> Alternative : Lack of companions 

<root> If this is a solo jump , which constitutes the minority of skydivers , your only recourse is to ensure that at least one of your own chutes opens . 

<root> In this case , the excellent advice offered by your instructors on assisting chute opening may be of assistance to you . 

<root> If it becomes apparent that you cannot open either of your two parachutes , or that for some other reason they are fatally non-functional , then the following steps may be of some minor assistance . 

<root> Appeal . 

<root> If you are of a religious turn of mind , you may wish at this point to offer a prayer to a god , goddess , protective spirit or guardian angel . 

<root> St Jude , the patron saint of Lost Causes , comes to mind . 

<root> Objectively , this is not likely to help very much ; but it may improve your emotional state . 

<root> If you do not have any religious beliefs , or are for another reason unwilling to appeal to your patron deity , skip this step . 

<root> Contemplate . 

<root> As you approach the Earth at , or close to , terminal velocity , you may wish to contemplate your past existence , and the possibility of a future afterlife . 

<root> A strategy that might prove helpful is to consider how fortunate you are that life has been good to you so far . 

<root> Alternatively , if life has not been good to you so far , ( and considering your current situation this seems more likely ) consider how lucky you are that it will not be troubling you much longer . 

<root> Expect impact . 

<root> You are unlikely to have the time or ability to aim for a soft landing-spot , body of water , or other impact site that might improve your chances of survival . 

<root> There is a minuscule chance that your impact will result in non-life-threatening injuries ; 

<root> if this seems incredibly far-fetched , comfort yourself that double chute failure in modern times is also extremely unlikely , and that you have already beaten worse odds . 

<root> Tips 

<root> Your reserve chute should have been packed by a certified rigger and is moderately less likely to fail ; 

<root> therefore , it may be helpful to focus your efforts on opening your reserve parachute . 

<root> Some humans who have , for various reasons , become aware of their impending death , develop psychological coping strategies to deal with this ; 

<root> for instance , the Kubler-Ross phases of grief . 

<root> Since your own death approaches far more quickly , this is unlikely to be of any use to you . 

<root> Warnings 

<root> Water landings : if you have successfully attached to a companion whose chute opens , keep in mind that both your arms may be broken or dislocated , and you may be unable to swim or tread water before your chute fills and drags you under . 

<root> If , after total chute failure , you land on something soft , it is possible that instead of being killed outright , you may be permanently paralyzed due to spinal injury . 

<root> If you have a strong aversion to this outcome , aiming head-downward before impact in the manner of an Olympic diver may ensure the destruction of your cranium and your immediate demise . 

<root> How to Stop Procrastinating 

<root> If you 're a chronic procrastinator , you know the pain and stress that comes with putting things off . 

<root> Although you may have the desire to accomplish something , getting the motivation to do it is a different matter . 

<root> Fortunately , overcoming your procrastination is easy to do when you put your mind to it . 

<root> Side note : If you have anything due right now , and you have n't finished it , leave this article and complete that work . 

<root> Steps 

<root> Create a to-do list . 

<root> Yes , make yourself an old fashioned to-do list with check boxes and everything . 

<root> List everything , big and small , that you have to do for your entire day ; break big activities into smaller bits if necessary . 

<root> Then , as you work through your day , check off each of the items on your list . 

<root> You will feel a growing sense of pride as you visually monitor your ever-diminishing list of projects . 

<root> Focus your list on including the things you typically put off , not the things you are sure to do on a regular basis . 

<root> If necessary , set time-frames for your items to be done by . 

<root> For example , list “ take the dog for a walk by 12:30 ” rather than simply “ walk the dog . ” 

<root> Re-evaluate your list halfway through your day to rank your items based on highest priority . 

<root> Then , tackle the most important ones before looking back at the smaller things to do . 

<root> Keep a notebook by hand before you start your workday . 

<root> Write every thought down that comes up during work . 

<root> Every single to do or things you want to do at that specific moment . 

<root> Do n't do it , put it on a list and do it later . 

<root> This prevents you from getting into the " procrastination zone . " 

<root> Finish the hard stuff . 

<root> When you have a looming project that 's bogging you down and making you unproductive in other areas , tackle it first . 

<root> Finishing the largest item on your list of things to do will make you feel extra productive and give you the boost to do other things you ’ve been pushing to the side . 

<root> If your “ big project ” is something that ca n’t be done in one sitting , make a list of small parts of it that you can accomplish today . 

<root> Do n’t worry about completing the entire thing , but take steps now so that doing so in the future is a breeze . 

<root> Make an ultimate to-do list for this single project , and have it placed somewhere you will see it on a regular basis . 

<root> As you mark things off , you will be motivated to continue doing so , and seeing it on a regular basis will remind you that your project needs to be done . 

<root> Do two-minute tasks . 

<root> Whenever you are presented with something that you do n’t want to do or would consider putting off , ask yourself , “ will this take me less than two minutes to finish ? ” 

<root> For many of us , this includes small chores , like taking out the trash or pulling a few weeds , but can include simple tasks in all areas of life . 

<root> Anything that you want to put off but takes two minutes to do - do it . 

<root> Simply force yourself to use the next 120 seconds to be productive and do the duty you normally would push off for hours or days . [ 1 ] . 

<root> Create a timed work frenzy . 

<root> If you find yourself being pulled off into the depths of daydreams , set a period of time to do nothing but work . 

<root> Take ten minutes and remove all distractions - your phone , magazines , or thoughts of your attractive love - and go into a working frenzy . 

<root> Force yourself to work productively for ten minutes , and then go back to whatever it was you were doing . 

<root> Chances are , you ’ll get into a groove and keep working at a high pace even when your frenzy time is out . 

<root> Working with a timer is generally regarded by most experts as being one of the best ways to develop self-discipline and stop procrastination . 

<root> The most famous method of working to strict time controls ( known as time-boxing ) involves creating a list of tasks . 

<root> Each task is then assigned an exact amount of time to complete . 

<root> If you do n't finish the task in the allotted time , then you move on to the next one . 

<root> Using this work arrangement , it forces you to take action , as you ca n't afford to waste any time . [ 2 ] . 

<root> Give yourself a break . 

<root> If you ca n’t seem to focus and are working half-heartedly at your tasks , give yourself a brief break . 

<root> Set a timer for ten minutes , and take a nap , read a book , or call your friend . 

<root> Do whatever it is you ’ve been daydreaming about so that the temptation is removed once you get back to work . 

<root> Just be sure to follow through with your deadline rather than ignoring it when your alarm finally goes off . 

<root> How to Play Muggle Quidditch 

<root> In the Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling the main wizarding sport is Quidditch . 

<root> However you do n't have to have magical powers to play . 

<root> There are many different ways of playing Quidditch , but the most commonly used set of rules are those given by the International Quidditch Association ( which can be found here ) . 

<root> In the past Muggle Quidditch has mainly been played at colleges in the US , but over the last few years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of community teams . 

<root> Quidditch has also spread outside of America and is now played on 5 continents . 

<root> Steps 

<root> Gather all needed materials and players ( see Things You 'll Need section below ) . 

<root> Know that all players can play while riding a broom . 

<root> Brooms can be a hindrance however , so feel free to not use brooms . 

<root> Place the quaffle and three bludgers in the middle of the field . 

<root> Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated so that they are easier to throw and catch . 

<root> Start the game . 

<root> Both teams start from the edges and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers . 

<root> Follow your duty depending what type of player you are : 

<root> Chasers try to score by throwing the quaffle into one of the three goal hoops . 

<root> Each score is worth 10 points . 

<root> Beaters try to peg players with their bludger . 

<root> If a player is pegged they have to stop what they 're doing and pay a penalty ; i.e. ( drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser ) and run back to and touch their goal post or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds . 

<root> Keepers guard the goal posts at each end and attempt to block chasers ' attempts at scoring . 

<root> If Keeper is close to their hoops they are safe from being hit by bludgers . 

<root> Seekers try to tackle the snitch ( a person ) or obtain an object attached to the snitch such as a sock or flag . 

<root> You can establish you own rules as to how a player catches the snitch . 

<root> A common way to play is to make the snitch a person , and give the snitch a head start to run and hide in defined boundaries . 

<root> Then the seekers search for the snitch , and attempt to tag the player . 

<root> Other methods , such as the method adopted in 2005 , makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock , hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner . 

<root> Regardless of method , the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team , unlike the books , in which the snitch is worth 150 points . 

<root> The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought that it was worth too many points so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch . 

<root> The snitch , generally a track runner , runs around ( usually the boundaries ) trying to evade the seekers . 

<root> The referee should ensure that rules are being followed . 

<root> They also keep track of the score . 

<root> Play the game ! 

<root> The object of the game is to score the most points and the game ends when the seeker snatches the snitch . 

<root> Feel free to alter the game rules . 

<root> See the Tips section for suggestions . 

<root> Video 

<root> How to Play a Real-Life Game of Quidditch 

<root> You do n't need flying broomsticks or magic balls to play this version of the game - it 's tailor-made for muggles like us . 

<root> This video shows a more realistic approach to playing Quidditch . 

<root> Tips 

<root> Alternatively the snitch can be a small yellow ball ( tennis balls work great ) that is hidden before the game starts by a bystander or referee . 

<root> Establish boundaries and have the seekers look for the snitch . 

<root> Beaters can try hitting the bludgers around in the air with a shortened hockey sticks or a short bat . 

<root> They could also use regular-length hockey sticks to hit bludgers ( perhaps wiffle balls ) on the ground . 

<root> The simplest way is to just peg players by throwing dodge balls . 

<root> It may be easier to play without brooms ( but also less fun ! ) . 

<root> Remember that the snitch runner , if you choose to use one , is not an actual player in the game , therefore , not bound by any of the rules . 

<root> If desired , the snitch is able to do whatever he or she wants to avoid capture . 

<root> See How to Be a Snitch in Quidditch for more information . 

<root> You can play water quidditch in a pool . 

<root> Almost all the same rules apply . 

<root> Have someone throw something ( the snitch ) on a line into the pool at regular intervals . 

<root> They can even use fake snitches . 

<root> You can buy authentic looking brooms to make the game more realistic . 

<root> There is a very large Quidditch community , have a look at the IQA website to find teams near you . 

<root> One variation is Quarter Snitch Quidditch . 

<root> Find a quarter or another small coin . 

<root> Have both of the teams turn around and have the referee throw it into the grass or pitch while the teams are n't looking . 

<root> Play while the seekers look for the snitch . 

<root> Another variation is where the referee places the snitch somewhere in the field ( in this case it 's a small ball ) . 

<root> The seeker has to find the snitch blindfolded , relying only on the coach 's instructions , while the game is still on . 

<root> Warnings 

<root> Stay hydrated and exercise wisely . 

<root> A ball flying in the air can hurt . 

<root> If you 're playing quidditch you 're probably just having fun so play nicely . 

<root> Things You 'll Need 

<root> 15 players 

<root> 14 brooms 

<root> Field ( or big backyard ) 

<root> 3 goal hoops per team 

<root> Referee ( optional ) 

<root> Color coded shirts or capes for houses , black for referee 

<root> 3 Bludgers ( dodge balls , water balloons , wiffle balls etc. ) 

<root> 1 Quaffle ( volleyball , Frisbee , soccer ball , etc . ) 

<root> 1 Snitch ( person ) 

<root> Each team is composed of : 

<root> 3 Chasers 

<root> 2 Beaters 

<root> 1 Keeper 

<root> 1 Seeker 

<root> How to Prepare Quinoa 

<root> Quinoa is known as the little rice of Peru . 

<root> The Incas treated the crop as sacred and referred to quinoa as " chisaya mama " or " mother of all grains . " [ 1 ] 

<root> By tradition , the Inca emperor would sow the first seeds of the season using " golden implements . " 

<root> Quinoa is rich in protein and much lighter than other grains . 

<root> It is much easier to prepare than rice and is rapidly gaining in popularity , especially among vegetarians who value its high protein levels . 

<root> Ingredients 

<root> 1 cup quinoa 

<root> 2 cups water ( or broth ) 

<root> Olive oil to taste ( Optional ) 

<root> 1/2 teaspoon salt ( Optional ) 

<root> Method 1 Cooking On A Stove Top 

<root> Rinse the grains of quinoa in water . 

<root> You can skip this step if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box . 

<root> To rinse , place the measured grain in a strainer under running water for a few minutes . 

<root> This is necessary to remove the excess saponins on the outside of the grains which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa if not removed . 

<root> Toast quinoa in a saucepan ( optional ) . 

<root> Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat . 

<root> Add the quinoa and cook for about 1 minute . 

<root> This brings out quinoa 's nutty flavor . 

<root> Cook the quinoa . 

<root> Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil . 

<root> Cover and reduce heat to low . 

<root> Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes or until the grain becomes translucent and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain . 

<root> Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ , in the same way as pasta . 

<root> Quinoa will continue cooking for a bit even after you take it off the heat . 

<root> Take the quinoa off the heat and let stand , covered , for 5 minutes . 

<root> This will give it time to absorb any moisture that might still be in the pan . 

<root> Uncover and fluff with a fork . 

<root> The quinoa should look light and fluffy , and you should be able to see the germ separating from the seed . 

<root> Serve . 

<root> Freshly cooked quinoa should be served immediately to retain nutritional value and a good flavor . 

<root> Serve with : 

<root> Stir-fry , using the quinoa as a substitute for rice . 

<root> Curry . 

<root> Braised meat . 

<root> In a salad . 

<root> Virtually any other combination you can think of ! 

<root> Method 2 Cooking In a Rice Cooker 

<root> Rinse 1 cup of quinoa in a fine mesh sieve under cold water . 

<root> If you bought packaged quinoa , this step is n't always necessary , but it 's better to be safe than sorry . 

<root> Pour quinoa into rice cooker . 

<root> One option is to toast the quinoa before placing in the rice cooker . 

<root> See Step # 2 in Method One above for directions . 

<root> Add 2 cups of liquid and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the rice cooker . 

<root> Water , chicken stock or broth , or vegetable stock all work . 

<root> Cook for approximately 15 minutes . 

<root> Some rice cooker will have different settings instead of a simple " cook " option . 

<root> Try the " white rice " option if your rice cooker gives you several options . 

<root> Let stand for about 5 minutes . 

<root> Fluff with a fork and serve . 

<root> Method 3 Cooking In the Oven 

<root> Preheat oven to 350 ° F ( 177 ° C ) . 

<root> Arrange rack in the middle of the oven . 

<root> Rinse quinoa thoroughly in a fine mesh seive under cold water . 

<root> In a medium saucepan , heat up 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-low heat . 

<root> Add onions , peppers , mushrooms , or any other type of desired vegetable or herb into the saucepan ( optional ) . 

<root> Cook onions until they are translucent , but not burned . 

<root> Sweat the peppers or vegetables along with the onions . 

<root> Add the quinoa and salt to the saucepan , stirring until completely incorporated . 

<root> This should take no longer than 30 seconds . 

<root> Add one cup of broth and one cup of water to the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium high heat . 

<root> Once a boil is reached , transfer quinoa to a 8-by-8-inch baking dish . [ 2 ] 

<root> Spread out quinoa evenly and cover baking dish completely with aluminum foil . 

<root> Cook the quinoa in the oven for roughly 20 minutes , or until most of the liquid is gone . 

<root> Remove the aluminum foil from the baking dish , add cheese or other seasonings , and bake for an additional 5 minutes . 

<root> After 5 minutes , the quinoa should be fully cooked . 

<root> Serve and enjoy !
