<root> From the AP comes this story : 

<root> President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area . 

<root> Bush nominated Jennifer M. Anderson for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia , replacing Steffen W. Graae . 

<root> *** 

<root> Bush also nominated A. Noel Anketell Kramer for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals , replacing John Montague Steadman . 

<root> The sheikh in wheel - chair has been attacked with a F - 16 - launched bomb . 

<root> He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons , since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they did n't . 

<root> Today 's incident proves that Sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace . 

<root> Nervous people make mistakes , so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks . 

<root> A la guerre c'est comme a la guerre ! 

<root> In the eastern city of Baqubah , guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police station , killing several people . 

<root> The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland , but this time the crew was safe . 

<root> In Fallujah , hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly arrested a yound newlywed bride . 

<root> ( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ) . 

<root> The US troops fired into the hostile crowd , killing 4 . 

<root> It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis . 

<root> Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company 's story to the ( miniscule number of ) people who have n't heard it . 

<root> Usually , these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up , but this time people are actually concerned about the company 's plans . 

<root> They work on Wall Street , after all , so when they hear a company who's stated goals include " Do n't be evil , " they imagine a company who's eventually history will be " Do n't be profitable . " 

<root> It 's not quite as freewheeling an environment as you 'd imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company 's self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea . 

<root> Read the entire article ; there 's a punchline , too . 

<root> My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat 's passing for al - Qaeda has appeared at Newsday . 

<root> Excerpt : 

<root> " Arafat 's secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiations remained rocky . 

<root> The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped , along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon had always opposed . 

<root> Arafat 's death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled . 

<root> Sharon 's assassination of major Hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party . 

<root> If the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership can not find a way to reinvigorate the peace process , cells of radical young Palestinians may grow up that look to bin Laden for their cues . 

<root> Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the festering Israeli - Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al - Qaida with young Muslim men . 

<root> Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror . " 

<root> Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday condemned Sharon 's murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , a religious leader of Hamas , the day before . 

<root> The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah , 50 km west of Baghdad , " condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in Iraq . " 

<root> Ash - Sharq al - Awsat reports that Fallujah was closed Tuesday in a general strike . 

<root> US troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight that left one Iraqi dead . 

<root> In Ramadi , there was a big demonstration . 

<root> Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said the attack was " criminal " and that " the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs , that of fighting and jihad " . 

<root> The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , " It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . . 

<root> This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region , " the message claimed . 

<root> Xinhua alleged that " Many of the Iraqis , who suffer the American occupation of Iraq , relate their case with that of the Palestinian people , under the Israeli occupation . " 

<root> In an apparently unrelated incidents , some eleven Iraqis were killed by snipers on Tuesday , including a group of police trainees in a bus near Hilla and two police in Kirkuk . 

<root> Ever since the first whispers about Google 's IPO , most investors have feared that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that , even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless execution , the price would be too high for investors to make a real profit . 

<root> We 've moved on . 

<root> We 've grown up . 

<root> Now , people wonder if Google can even survive . 

<root> That 's overstating it , I know . 

<root> What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it 's always been -- a great search engine with some real grass - roots support , successful by the grace of simplicity . 

<root> Simplicity gave it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - based ads , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection . 

<root> The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - fewest - features between low - end camera companies . 

<root> The other problem ? 

<root> It 's tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus . 

<root> As the survey cited in the above - linked article shows , most Google users do n't intend to use Gmail , and Google is n't even as popular as Yahoo! and AOL . 

<root> If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine . 

<root> Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed ? 

<root> Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust . 

<root> Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest : 

<root> TEHRAN ( AFP ) - 

<root> An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed . 

<root> " We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in , " Masoud Shojai , head of the country 's " Iran Cartoon " association and the fair organizer , said . 

<root> " They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison , " he added . 

<root> " Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ? " 

<root> Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran 's Palestine Contemporary Art Museum . 

<root> He added that around 1,100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show . 

<root> He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12,000 , 8,000 and 5,000 dollars respectively . 

<root> This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are . 

<root> When they saw a cartoon of their prophet , people had to die . 

<root> When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world . 

<root> US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday , though they were still meeting pockets of resistance . 

<root> The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants , including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars . 

<root> Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on Wednesday , leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul , Baiji , and Tuz . 

<root> Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , according to az - Zaman . 

<root> The battles and demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah . 

<root> Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack . 

<root> Allawi 's aged cousin and the man 's wife and daughter - in - law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped . 

<root> In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him . 

<root> The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday , but still face pockets of resistance . 

<root> If Samarra and other cities are any guide , those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come . 

<root> The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections . 

<root> He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation . 

<root> The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections . 

<root> Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault , both in Iraq and in Washington . 

<root> For some black satire on Fallujah , see Unconfirmed Sources which has some fun with my Weblog . 

<root> [ Am at a conference and ca n't blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days . ] 

<root> The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons . 

<root> Al - Qaeda wants them , Iran wants them , Russia wants the better ones , and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal . 

<root> For the last few years there have been tensions with Iran ’s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency . 

<root> At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program . 

<root> Arial photos , loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented . 

<root> Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’s ever seen . 

<root> President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have . 

<root> With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons . 

<root> Right now that seems to be the US , EU , and IAEA . 

<root> But not always do those three agree , and not always are their decisions equal . 

<root> The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength . 

<root> It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern . 

<root> North Korea ’s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago . 

<root> It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons . 

<root> But getting past who should get them , is who has them , and who is really close . 

<root> The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu . 

<root> Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched , somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq . 

<root> America cried wolf in Iraq , and what ’s scary is that sooner or later , that wolf will probably get us . 

<root> I ran across this item on the Internet . 

<root> Sooooo . 

<root> The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U.S. citizens ( most of whom were " dual - citizens " ) . 

<root> Then , eschewing normal procedure , the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U.S. citizen . 

<root> Why ? 

<root> To pander to the mythical " Arab street " , of course . 

<root> Now , I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon ( considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years ) . 

<root> In other words , those Americans were there by their own choice , mired in a situation that was totally predictable . 

<root> Yet we did n't charge them for the evacuation . 

<root> This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U.S. citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon . 

<root> And what do we get for this effort ? 

<root> A lawsuit . 

<root> That 's right , folks . 

<root> The American - Arab Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts . 

<root> Here 's an excerpt from the article : 

<root> Nina Chahine , 19 , who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13 . 

<root> The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war , she said . 

<root> " We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home , " Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit . 

<root> " We were all American citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us . 

<root> No communications nothing . 

<root> I was on my way to my wedding fearing death , basically . " 

<root> Chahine said her immediate family spent about $ 20,000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan . 

<root> Dear Nina , 

<root> Here 's a tip : Do n't get married in countries that house illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under counter-attack ! 

<root> Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemmas of their own making . 

<root> Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin 's " White House Briefing " column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ) : 

<root> At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs . 

<root> This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he has n't anticipated . 

<root> " Q Thank you -- I was wondering , there 's a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President . 

<root> After you are elected in 2004 , what will your memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ? 

<root> " THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate that . 

<root> ( Laughter . ) 

<root> There is a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all , I do n't know . 

<root> I 'm just speculating now . 

<root> I really have n't thought about writing a book . 

<root> My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job . 

<root> ( Laughter . ) 

<root> But if -- there 's a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff , and there are at least two other horsemen following . 

<root> It 's a Western scene by a guy named W.H.S. Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep . ' 

<root> It 's on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O'Neill in Midland , Texas . 

<root> He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 . 

<root> Four months later , we were married . 

<root> So he 's got a -- I 'm a decision - maker and I can make good decisions . 

<root> ( Applause . ) 

<root> " And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer . 

<root> ( Laughter . ) 

<root> This is not a filibuster . 

<root> ( Laughter . ) 

<root> That 's a Senate term -- particularly on good judges . 

<root> ( Applause . ) 

<root> The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor . 

<root> Laura and I are Methodists . 

<root> One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn . 

<root> The painting is based upon the hymn called , ' A Charge to Keep . ' 

<root> I have . 

<root> The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life . 

<root> I -- which I try to do , as best as I possibly can . 

<root> ( Applause . ) 

<root> " The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep . 

<root> And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office . 

<root> ( Applause . ) " 

<root> Now that 's a rambling response . 

<root> And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called " A Charge to Keep " ? 

<root> That was the name of his " autobiography " -- ghost - written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 . 

<root> There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new browser and / or acquiring Firefox . 

<root> It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode . 

<root> They have acquired Urchin , Zipdash , Applied Semantics , Picasa , Blogger , and satellite imaging company Keyhole , so why not Firefox ? 

<root> I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox . 

<root> Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox . 

<root> He announced this in January : 

<root> As of January 10 , 2005 , my source of income changed from The Mozilla Foundation to Google , Inc. of Mountain View , California . 

<root> My role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged , I will continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of successful 1.1 , 1.5 and 2.0 releases . 

<root> I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general . 

<root> He also announced this in January : 

<root> Welcome Darin ! 

<root> I just want to extend a big " Welcome ! " to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week . 

<root> 2005 is going to rock ! 

<root> Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25 , 2005 : 

<root> Me and the big " G " 

<root> Following on the heels of Ben 's annoucement yesterday , I thought I 'd post that I have joined Google as well . 

<root> Like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-) 

<root> Posted by darin 

<root> Ben made another announcement on March 28 , 2005 : 

<root> I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google ! 

<root> Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years , ... 

<root> Great to have you on board ! 

<root> Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it 's an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something . 

<root> In this case , following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google - Mozilla / Firefox relationship . 

<root> If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran . 

<root> In this movie Google and Amazon ( GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008 . 

<root> This is one thought - provoking film . 

<root> Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer . 

<root> Just one small commment - it 's not possible , as far as I know , for Google to " Aquire " Firefox . 

<root> They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about . 

<root> I 'm inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non-Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they 're ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team . 

<root> It 's this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive . 

<root> Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic . 

<root> Thanks for the link . 

<root> Malach , What you say makes sense . 

<root> Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go . 

<root> It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis-matches . 

<root> The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr 's movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance . 

<root> How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ? 

<root> Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ? 

<root> At a time when the Spanish , Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving , and the UN is reluctant to get involved ? 

<root> One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA . 

<root> State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration . 

<root> The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up . 

<root> Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives , most of whom had no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ) . 

<root> They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick . 

<root> ( Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess . ) 

<root> The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts . 

<root> The Washington Monthly 's Who 's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA . 

<root> Sept. 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who is close to the Bush administration , admitted on Sept. 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to " protect Israel , " according to the Asian Times . 

<root> I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists . 

<root> But they have n't been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks . 

<root> Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi . 

<root> This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at . 

<root> There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ) , and I keep revising this posting this evening because I do n't want to fall into it . 

<root> But sometimes , of course , when Z happens after X it is because of X . 

<root> So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada : 

<root> ' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group 's " striking arm " in Iraq . 

<root> " I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas , " Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah . 

<root> Last month , Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas . 

<root> " Let ( Hamas ) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same , " al - Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , his home base south of Baghdad . 

<root> He did comment on what he meant by the phrase . ' 

<root> And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization , and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization , which leaves 7 US soldiers dead . 

<root> The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoked it and why ? 

<root> I 'm not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing . 

<root> Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for . 

<root> Why were they suddenly acted on Saturday ? 

<root> i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out . 

<root> I definitely could use a drink , actually a couple would probably do better .

<root> All : 

<root> It is my understanding , from good sources in the Gov s office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts . 

<root> The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone 's right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through . 

<root> In other words the table is set . 

<root> Deal your meal from where the dishes are located . 

<root> I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties . 

<root> It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access . 

<root> Power be where power lies . 

<root> you are n't going in for the wedding until sunday now ? 

<root> I 'm in

<root> I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP . 

<root> Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA . 

<root> However , he also mentioned we were a close sixth , that is close to the fifth highest bid . 

<root> He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid . 

<root> He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure . 

<root> NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter , I believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP . 

<root> Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP . 

<root> Thanks ,

<root> On or about September 23 , 1999 a request for service was placed by the above referenced counterparty . 

<root> The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement . 

<root> These agreements were forwarded to the counterparty , CCNG , Inc. . 

<root> On or about October 6 , 1999 , Kelly Cloud , Senior Vice President of CCNG , Inc. ( 713 ) 235-1972 , called and informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM , L.P. . 

<root> Further , she informed me that Section 7 of the agreement , which reads in part : Gas is free from liens and adverse claims of every kind , should be changed because the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and / or is subject to liens . 

<root> She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of Section 7 . 

<root> Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7 . 

<root> Kelly 

<root> Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions . 

<root> Thanks .

<root> I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle . 

<root> I might just sell the car and get you to drive me around all winter . 

<root> How about skidoo skis for the front and tracks for the back .. 

<root> Lexus IS 300 . 

<root> Not sure if I am going to buy 17 " or 16 " wheels for the winter . 

<root> Jackass . 

<root> You have always been on the move seeking affectionate , satisfying and harmonious relationships . 

<root> Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love , self - sacrifice and mutual trust . 

<root> It has often been said that " True love is just around the corner " ... and maybe ... if you have n't found it as yet - you possibly soon will . 

<root> In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without . 

<root> You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem . 

<root> You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care ... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past ... and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment .. 

<root> Whatever you strive to do , something always seems to be holding you back . 

<root> There is no subterfuge in you . 

<root> You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life , in a relationship , is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can , together , develop a foundation of trust based on understanding . 

<root> You are your own person ... and you demand freedom of thought ... to follow your own convictions . 

<root> You have no interest in " two - timing " and all you seek is sincerity and " straight - dealing " . 

<root> You wish to be left in peace ... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ... 

<root> In fact you just do n't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ... 

<root> All you want is for " them " to get on with it - and to leave you alone .. 

<root> John , 

<root> sorry for not sending it to you earlier ( totally forgot to open my outlook ) .

<root> Can you send me the data you used : I shall take a look at it . 

<root> Vince 

<root> Dear All , 

<root> My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi . 

<root> I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article " The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives " and he had mailed me the copy . 

<root> I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper " Making the most of mean reversion " to estimate the mean reversion speed . 

<root> I use Queensland half - hourly price during 13 December , 1998 - 30 June 2001 giving about 44,000 price observations . 

<root> However , the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept . 

<root> The coefficient and standard error are as followed : 

<root> Intercept : - 0.3931 ( 0.0076 ) 

<root> Slope : 0.1171 ( 0.0022 ) 

<root> R Square : 0.0585 

<root> Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign . 

<root> I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same . 

<root> It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter .

<root> This is the best solution given all the uncertainties we face .

<root> Vince - 

<root> Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group . 

<root> Right now , we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year . 

<root> Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer . 

<root> What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis , who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo 's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer . 

<root> When we start the summer process , we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group . 

<root> Is this okay with you ? 

<root> Hope all is well with you 

<root> Take Care 

<root> Traci 

<root> Traci , 

<root> I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday . 

<root> One of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship . 

<root> He came across as a very bright person , very personable . 

<root> I can take him as a summer intern . 

<root> Vince 

<root> Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski , 

<root> Hi . 

<root> How are you doing ? 

<root> I hope you have a good flight back to home . 

<root> It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector . 

<root> Thank you for your time . 

<root> I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk . 

<root> However , you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again . 

<root> Those attachments are what I was asked . 

<root> Again , it was a good chance for me to get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on in school . 

<root> I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day . 

<root> Thank you .

<root> Renee , 

<root> I would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology . 

<root> Scott Neal and Tom Martin would like to attend as well . 

<root> This afternoon at 2 PM or later would work for us . 

<root> Please let me know what time we could meet . 

<root> Thank you , 

<root> Phillip 

<root> Phillip , 

<root> This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event . 

<root> The way the tax law works , the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent . 

<root> As such , we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent . 

<root> We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement ( 6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares ) . 

<root> If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check , we can distribute gross shares . 

<root> Please let me know you preference . 

<root> As you know , we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt . 

<root> As such , we have a CPA , Larry Lewis , working with us to audit and set up transition files . 

<root> He has become our department expert on the PSA account ( much more knowledgeable than myself ) and the various plan provision amendments . 

<root> If you would like , we can set up a conference call with you , myself , and Larry to go over the payment methodology . 

<root> Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you . 

<root> Thanks , 

<root> Renee 

<root> Renee , 

<root> Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units . 

<root> It is clear that the payment will be made in shares . 

<root> However , I still do n't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares . 

<root> The plan document under VII . 

<root> Amount of Benefit Payments reads " The value of the shares , and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment , and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock . " 

<root> Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account . 

<root> Thank you , 

<root> Phillip Allen 

<root> Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline . 

<root> I am expecting to pay something in the $ 3, to $ 5,000 range . 

<root> I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done . 

<root> It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding . 

<root> If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify . 

<root> Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release . 

<root> If the negotiations stall , it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities . 

<root> Hopefully things will go smoothly .

<root> Frequent travelers and executives are among the masses that get a lot of discount in the airfare . 

<root> It is easy to get discount airfare for them since they travel very frequently . 

<root> Cheap air tickets for Corporate 

<root> Some of the corporate also get cheap air tickets because they tie up with some of the airlines for a certain period based on the discount and services they get from the airlines . 

<root> Corporate plans are clubbed with other services through some agencies to provide better service for their staff . 

<root> Promotional discount airfare 

<root> Some countries like Malaysia and Singapore promote trading for foreign visitors during some part of the year . 

<root> During this period , they offer cheap air tickets to their country on certain flights . 

<root> If you can check with the other airlines during this period , you may get excellent discount airfare , which may even surprise you .

<root> Several years ago I developed a short paper and pencil screening test which , in a small pilot study , discriminated between ADHD , LD , and control subjects . 

<root> I recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and , subsequently , to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the Internet . 

<root> The test itself is what is called a substitution test . 

<root> It has two parts , both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder . 

<root> I am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it . 

<root> The test , along with an information form , is available at : . 

<root> I think a test like this one is much needed . 

<root> A person can take it directly instead of others completing behavioral checklists or a completing a lengthy program intensive test like TOVA . 

<root> Perhaps you are willing to recommend this site and , if you have a website , place a link on your website .

<root> I 'm a freelance journalist specializing in health , with 30 years experience . 

<root> I 'm the author of three books ( including the 1.3 million seller ALTERNATIVE CURES ) and hundreds of magazine articles , and worked for 20 years at Rodale Press , as a writer and as editor - in - chief of Prevention and Rodale Books . 

<root> Currently , I am writing a book on natural supplements to aid weight loss , with Harry Preuss , MD , a Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University ; it is scheduled for publication by Broadway ( Random House ) in January 2007 . 

<root> I am seeking anecdotes ( first name , last initial ) from dieters who successfully used a natural supplement to assist their weight loss ; the therapeutic agents under discussion include HCA , MCT , green or oolong tea extract , CLA , chromium , starch - blockers , chitosan , 5 - HTP , hoodia and caralluma , HMB , and BCAA . 

<root> If you 've successfully used any of these supplement to aid weight loss , please write me at gottlie...@yahoo.com and let me know , telling me about your experience . 

<root> Thank you for your time and attention . 

<root> Warm regards ,

<root> Once upon a time ( in 2001 , to be specific ) , the Coca - Cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala . 

<root> In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land , the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth . 

<root> But within a few short months , the village people began to notice their wells were running dry , so they complained to the corporation . 

<root> Coca - Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer , saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams . 

<root> After several years of use , we arrive at the present day when the village people have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling plant 's waste sludge and is laden with cadmium , a highly toxic , cancer - causing heavy metal . 

<root> The village soil and water are now too heavily contaminated to safely occupy human life , so the plant was shut down last week . 

<root> Moral of the story : Do n't drink Coke .......... drink Pepsi ! 

<root> Just kidding , Pepsi is actually in the process of being thrown out of India for similar crimes , as well . 

<root> The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center ( GNOFHAC ) filed a housing discrimination complaint against the Housing Authority of New Orleans ( HANO ) last week . 

<root> The complaint , filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development , accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement entered into between former St. Thomas Housing Development residents , the City of New Orleans , HANO , and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St. Thomas , now known as River Garden . 

<root> The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St. Thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement . 

<root> Upon return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina evacuation , former residents have been informed that there are no available public housing units at River Garden because those units have been reserved for HANO employees . 

<root> Therefore , public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless , as a result . 

<root> " In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , affordable housing in New Orleans is more scarce than ever . 

<root> As such , it is essential that HANO comply with 2003 enforcement agreement , " said James Perry , GNOFHAC Executive Director 

<root> Crude - oil prices rose Wednesday as strengthening Hurricane Rita , now a Category 5 storm , threatened to disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico . 

<root> New York 's main contract , light sweet crude for delivery in November rose 60 cents to close at 66.80 dollars per barrel . 

<root> In London , the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery advanced 53 cents to 64.73 dollars . 

<root> After brushing the Florida Keys islands on Tuesday , Rita packed winds of about 240 kilometers an hour as it headed across the Gulf of Mexico . 

<root> The US National Hurricane Center said Rita was " extremely dangerous " and could become a top - level category five storm on the Saffir - Simpson scale . 

<root> The storm threatened oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico where about one - quarter of US oil operations are based . 

<root> Oil companies evacuated offshore facilities as the storm 's progress kept global markets on tenterhooks . 

<root> In Texas , BP shut its 460,000 barrels per day refinery and Marathon shut its 72,000 bpd plant .

<root> ( New Scientist Space ) 

<root> NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week . 

<root> [ ... ] 

<root> " It 's not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon , " says Brett Alexander , vice-president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS . 

<root> NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010 , which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS . 

<root> Outsourcing these responsibilities would be a wise alternative , considering the accomplishments of the private sector regarding the space elevator . 

<root> Although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good , NASA seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world . 

<root> ( New Scientist Space ) 

<root> On 3 November , NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $ 500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years . 

<root> " That kind of a financial incentive [ ... ] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge , " Griffin said . 

<root> " I hope that industry , if put to the test , can do better [ than the government ] , but I do not expect it , " Griffin added . 

<root> Only time will reveal whether Griffin 's expectations are either exceeded or confirmed . 

<root> But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ) , it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .

<root> [ http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/apmideast_story.asp?category=1107&slug=Palestinians%20Abbas ] 

<root> Normally this author is semi-objective ( what blogger is ) but on the Seattlepi.com ( see source link ) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border ( which includes East Jerusalem by the way ) . 

<root> One thing is certain for sure . 

<root> If Abbas keeps up this " macho talk " he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas ( which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians ) rule the West Bank . 

<root> AP Photo / Nasser Nasser 

<root> Interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan. 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday Dec. 25 , 2004 . 

<root> Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat 's legacy , Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood . 

<root> It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel . 

<root> He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself . 

<root> Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel 's partially completed West Bank barrier . 

<root> Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants . 

<root> Abbas , a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed , called the refugee issue " very important and very dangerous . " 

<root> Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process . 

<root> If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer . 

<root> Selah !

<root> [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4281450.stm ] 

<root> ( Hat Tip : Captain s Quarters ) 

<root> ( BBC ) 

<root> The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence . 

<root> Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel , weeks after its military withdrew from the territory . 

<root> In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes . 

<root> Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make " unrestricted " strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight . 

<root> It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group . 

<root> Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas 's leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it's former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil . 

<root> Hamas has become rather unpopular in Gaza , as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil . 

<root> Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad . 

<root> ( Jerusalem Post ) 

<root> " We 're not happy with Hamas 's position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians , " commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official . 

<root> " But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda . " 

<root> [ ... ] 

<root> " The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel 's scheme to destroy the Palestinians ' infrastructure , " Habib said . 

<root> " Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression . 

<root> Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war . " 

<root> Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire , and hopes to turn the Gaza strip " into a vast battlefield . " 

<root> Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .

<root> I 'm suppose to start a job at Cracker Barrel , but I ca n't risk losing the job because I have two visible tattoos on my arm . 

<root> If you know or work there could you enlighten me ? 

<root> Why do n't you phone another location and ask ♥

<root> I have a male and female cockatiel , and there are 2 eggs in the bottom of the cage , will they hatch ? 

<root> Most likely not , if there is not a bird sitting on the eggs . 

<root> This is hard to tell . 

<root> Cockatiels can lay unfertilized eggs as well . 

<root> Just because you have a male and female , it can not be guaranteed the two mated . 

<root> You can try picking up the eggs and holding it up against a very bright light . 

<root> If you see a dark spot in the egg , that means it is fertilized and will hatch if cared for properly . 

<root> Have fun . 

<root> Why is the city called Miramar ? 

<root> I 'm not sure about the origin of the name but they are a lot of different cities with different and unique names like Miramar so it 's just a name . 

<root> There 's lots of towns called Miramar , it 'd help a lot if you listed a state or some sort of context you 're looking for it in . 

<root> Here 's two examples : 

<root> There 's a Miramar in Florida , just north of Miami . 

<root> There 's also a Miramar in California , the site of a rather large Air Force Base ... 

<root> Miramar California is a bit north of San Diego .

<root> If you HAVE a cat of course . 

<root> My cat s name is Twinky . 

<root> When she was a tiny little kitten she looked like those twinky snack cakes .

<root> I have a Norwegian Forest Cat that is named Achilles bc as a kitten he always attacked your feet when you walked by !

<root> what does it mean when a veiled chameleon egg is soft ? 

<root> my female chameleon just laid eggs yesterday and today some of the eggs are soft when i mean soft i mean like not like ordinary chameleon eggs . 

<root> They are probably infertile . 

<root> If there is no male they are probably infertile ! 

<root> If you take a flash light and shine it through the eggs and you see nothing throw them away ! 

<root> If you do not they will start to rot ! 

<root> If she has no male to fertilize the eggs , the eggs will aways be infertile . 

<root> if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs . 

<root> Hope she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny ! 

<root> If she continues ! 

<root> Hope this helps

<root> It 'll take you to all the major sites ( GG Bridge , Haight , Chinatown , etc ) and you can get off anyplace you want to spend more time at . 

<root> Go to Goldstar.com and get tickets for about a third of the price . 

<root> alcatraz island 

<root> Take a ferry ride !!! 

<root> It 's an amazing experience ! 

<root> Is it better to book a cruise online or by a travel agent ? 

<root> First time to go on A cruise any and all info is appreciated 

<root> Personally , I do n't find a travel agent to be of value to me as I am willing to put in the time doing research on the internet . 

<root> I have not had good experience with travel agents . 

<root> They do n't seem to know anything but the hype they are told and the packages they have available to them . 

<root> The one time I actually booked through a travel agent I did not get all of the amenities I had paid for . 

<root> The few times I have consulted with a travel agent I was able to find the same for less on my own , and more options than what they were selling . 

<root> So now I do not bother with them at all . 

<root> best is using an online travel agent 

<root> My Hamster escaped .... NEED HELP NOW !? 

<root> okay .... I have a dog and my mother is really really terrified of hamsters . 

<root> Well last night while I was sleeping , my hamster escaped from his cage . 

<root> He is in my room , but there are so many things inside there , I du n no what to do . 

<root> I have lots of containers in there . 

<root> Anybody give me ideas like a trap or something ? 

<root> Find him before he finds the dog food . 

<root> I 'm not kidding , I once lost a hamster in my house 3 months later I walk down in the basement and it was as big as a rat . 

<root> It had been eating dog food the whole time . 

<root> It was huge and scared the crap out of me . 

<root> Make sure he is n't trapped somewhere & put a bowl of food out . 

<root> He will come and eat 

<root> Start cleaning and start looking . 

<root> can i have some indoor pet ideas please !!!!!!!!!!!!!? 

<root> i want a small indoor pet that my mother will let me have please help 

<root> i want something cheap east to take care of and something to hopefully fit in my room 

<root> no pet is really easy to take care of . 

<root> they all need love and attn , food , proper surroundings etc . 

<root> the easiest thing would be a fish - but u need to clean the tank weekly , feed it the right amt , etc etc x 

<root> Having a pet is n't easy . 

<root> You should treat all pets like children . 

<root> They require a lot of attention or they get fussy and tear stuff up . 

<root> If you want easy then go with a gold fish or hamster . 

<root> I would go with a small rodent such as a mouse , rat , hamster or gerbil if you want something you can handle and hold . 

<root> Fish are probably the easiest to take care of though . 

<root> french male sensuality ? 

<root> I ve been dating a man from brittany france for a couple of months now .

<root> It s still a fairly new relationship and we have nt had sex yet so it s kind of a big deal . 

<root> I just do nt want to freak him out or make him feel uncomfortable . 

<root> Is it ok for a woman in french culture to make the first move ? 

<root> What do french men find sexy ? 

<root> French women are the ones to say yes , the way we say it is not usually as straigthforward as you propose to do . 

<root> Why not wait for him in a sexy dress with lunch or dinner , or a light snack at his house . 

<root> And you take it up from there . 

<root> Just make sure that it is a light meal with little alcohol .

<root> SERVERS 

<root> When my server crashed , Greg worked from 7 PM until 4 AM and had my company up and running the next morning . 

<root> That 's what I call customer service ! 

<root> It 's fine for ... 

<root> It 's fine for mass - market chocolate , but with companies like Scharffen Berger , TCHO , and smaller artisan chocolate makers in the area , why ? 

<root> Rip Off ! 

<root> 45 p for tap water ! 

<root> Ridiculous ! 

<root> Do n't think I 've ever been charged before .

<root> it was worth of the ride more than an hour ... 

<root> I had so many strawberries right on the field ... strongly recomend ... do nt forget to try their great ice cream 

<root> wrong location 

<root> this is not where the Blue Water Bridge Duty Free is located . 

<root> It is , surprisingly , near the Blue Water Bridges , some miles to the west of this location . 

<root> such a great idea this was , so easy to load and pack , no ramp , no step up no back aches . 

<root> moving with a pod was the best moving experience i have had . 

<root> Totally flavored 

<root> The statement about " best hamburguers in town " can be even amplifiaed to " best hamburguers in world " Totally worth , juicy , big , fresh , and excellent customer service !

<root> Thank - You for sharing your cottage ! 

<root> Great lunch specials . 

<root> Delivery is lightning fast . 

<root> Perfect since I 'm on a budget . 

<root> But otherwise , it can feel pricey for what you get . 

<root> Like the sushi , do n't like the pad thai . 

<root> Holly - the owner , knows exactly how to make you feel beautiful in clothes . 

<root> Stylish and contemporary , no matter your size or personality type . 

<root> She 's an A + and so are her clothes ! 

<root> Very poor customer service . 

<root> There are a couple decent people working there , but the rest are VERY dishonest , as well as rude , I have yet to hear the truth come out of their mouths . 

<root> Give them a try ! 

<root> The pizzas are huge and super delicious . 

<root> They 're our favorite pizza place to order from ... and they 're a local , family owned company ! 

<root> How much better does it get ?! 

<root> I loved the atmosphere here and the food is good , however the tables are so close together that it feels very cramped . 

<root> We were made to feel very welcome . 

<root> Well worth a visit .

<root> I will never come here again . 

<root> I am a new patient . 

<root> I have visited Dr. Cooper 's office twice and I am very impressed with how friendly and polite the staff is . 

<root> I found the office to be very clean and professional - looking . 

<root> Want a great burger ? 

<root> The smokehouse ca n't be beat anywhere . 

<root> Salad bar is hit and miss for freshness - sometimes the broccoli looks browned around the edges . 

<root> Never a bad smokehouse burger though ! 

<root> I crave those . 

<root> Natasha is the BEST photographer we have ever worked with . 

<root> She has a great way with children and is able to capture their personality as well as many spontaneous images .

<root> Great Meal 

<root> Happened on to this place while out of town on business , and it was great !

<root> ONe of a few . 

<root> Hancocks is one of four fabric stores in Fort Smith . 

<root> We have Hobby Lobby , Just for Fun Fabrics , Walmart , and Interior Mall just inside Barling . 

<root> They do have a good selection of fabric and notions . 

<root> It was ok , nice management , they let us check in early , but the place was old . 

<root> It was clean , but just a little dumpy . 

<root> Lots of room for big rig parking . 

<root> Hard to get into though because of road construction . 

<root> I 'll admit I was n't expecting much from this place , but they really did do a good job . 

<root> The chicken cordon - blu was tasty and came in a huge portion size for the money . 

<root> Service was a touch slow , but friendly . 

<root> find another place 

<root> Run down . 

<root> Dark , dark main room . 

<root> No way to read / relax . 

<root> ' Electric ' blanket on one bed did not heat . 

<root> Quite cold . 

<root> Removing 90 % of ' sit - abouts ' in main room would look cleaner . 

<root> recommended 

<root> Excellent location . 

<root> Good sports bar . 

<root> Hyatt web site improved . 

<root> Accurate check - out . 

<root> Rooms clean . 

<root> Lifts quick , clean , accurate , and correctly sized .

<root> Quality of work is sufficient but not outstanding . 

<root> Like all oil place changes , ask / recommend the 100 other services they have . 

<root> Will be a repeat customer with discount coupons . 

<root> criminal defense lawyer 

<root> Mr. Villega is an exceptional California criminal defense lawyer .

<root> If you want an attorney who will defend your right , contact Law Offices of Armando Villega 

<root> Checked in real late , but staff was very kind and helpful . 

<root> Rooms very clean and smelled very fresh . 

<root> I would recommend this hotel to anyone .

<root> Thanks for following me around the store 

<root> Enough said . 

<root> I do n't steal , I was n't acting suspiciously . 

<root> I was ready to buy a new jacket , a new sweater and a couple of your overpriced belts and I walked out because of your obvious lurking

<root> GREAT Store GREAT Service ! 

<root> “ This store is great !! 

<root> I love walking in and not being hassled . 

<root> I was there when they did a free raffle in August and I won a hard drive ! 

<root> The reason I go back is because the employees are sooooo nice . ” 

<root> Horrible customer service . 

<root> I came in to get a nice gift for my wife . 

<root> The one guy who was there , I 'm guessing was the owner , was probably the least helpful person I 've ever met . 

<root> But thankfully there are other flowers shops around Norman . 

<root> Pure Beauty 

<root> What a joy to stroll off historic Canyon Road in Santa Fe into a gallery with a gorgeous diversity of art . 

<root> Destiny Allison 's metal sculptures were my favorite . 

<root> The owner Karla is welcoming and fun . 

<root> Give yourself the gift of visiting Winterowd Fine Art ! 

<root> Great Place ! 

<root> This is one of my favorite places to eat for lunch . 

<root> They offer a good portions at a great price , it 's enough food to fill you up , but you do n't ever feel like you ate too much . 

<root> Plus , it 's super healthy ! 

<root> Barb does an AMAZING JOB , she is always learning new things on how to use her hands and body , to give every person an AWESOME MASSAGE , CALL TODAY AND SCHEDULE YOU MUST SEE HER , YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE SHE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST ! 

<root> If you want cheaply made glass from India and China , this is not your place . 

<root> These people only carry the very best American blown glass . 

<root> Their selection is top notch and the staff is very knowledgable . 

<root> Go to the Looking Glass for all your smoking needs !!!!!!!!!! 

<root> Chuck and Gretchen were very positive , and when Alan 's refused to work on my bike , Chuck came right out and saw the problem and did what Alan 's mechanic would n't do . 

<root> He worked on it right on the back of my car . 

<root> I am extremely pleased 

<root> Quick and Cheap 

<root> Walked in and was out ta there in 10 mins with a really good deal i thought i was going to be paying a lot because i had a DUI but with my DUI and Sr - 22 they were able to get me the best deal out there . 

<root> Is not a service office 

<root> This is a delivery office only and does not take walk ins but they do have a blue box out front . 

<root> Glad I called before I arrived with my box to ship . 

<root> Thought adding a comment would save someone the hassle with a useless trip there . 

<root> the food is mediocre at best . 

<root> the waitress took my name and then called me that all night . 

<root> not sure how I feel about that one . 

<root> it 's passable as a pub , but the pizza is not that great . 

<root> if you want good pizza , go to famoso . 

<root> seriously . 

<root> Anyone else find it a little suspicious that there are not only 20 reviews for this dentist ( a HUGE number compared to the others in the area ) , but that they all have the same unique grammar structure ? 

<root> And they seem to be posted at fairly regular intervals ? 

<root> Best YET ! 

<root> We go to Japaneiro 's all the time and we have NEVER been disappointed ! 

<root> Wait staff is always ready to help if you ca n't decide ( which happens every time for me d / t the huge menu of rolls ) and always courteous ! 

<root> Soooo tasty ! 

<root> Good honest wrok 

<root> Harlan provides great service . 

<root> He is very knowledgeable and took the time to explain the repairs to me . 

<root> The work on my car was done quickly and I felt I could trust his work . 

<root> I have nothing but fantastic things to say . 

<root> I highly recommend his shop . 

<root> Best in Memphis 

<root> This shop is by far the best I have been to . 

<root> I have a Saab ... which everything is expensive on and they have been extrememly fair and price a lot lower than any other shop I called . 

<root> They are the only place I would take my car peiod . 

<root> Took a laptop in for a video cable to be replaced . 

<root> Everything except the display worked fine before I took it in . 

<root> The video cable was replaced and suddenly the motherboard was dead . 

<root> Phone calls were n't returned when promised and the botched repair took a week longer than promised . 

<root> We have stayed at Tanglewood for many years now . 

<root> We go over about 5 times a year . 

<root> We have never had a problem with the cabins . 

<root> They are always so helpful . 

<root> The cabins have always been clean . 

<root> Helen is a wonderful place to take you family . 

<root> We recommend these cabins ! 

<root> Ca n't say enough 

<root> I used to tan down the street before I was referred to this place by one of my friends . 

<root> WOW ! 

<root> I did n't know what I was missing . 

<root> The lowest bed here is better than my last salon s highest level . 

<root> Salon is clean and girls are nice . 

<root> Great People and even better service ! 

<root> Best to deal with ! 

<root> In a few words ... I 'm pleasantly surprised that you can still find " old school " service out there where company care more about good name and customers than their pockets ... 

<root> Highly recommended people / business . 

<root> Thanks Josh ! 

<root> Dentist you can trust 

<root> If possible I try the services on myself before I bring in my son . 

<root> Drs. Ali work wonders . 

<root> Neither me nor my son have n't had a single cavity since we started dental care there . 

<root> The team focus is prevention and education . 

<root> That alone makes them unique . 

<root> This is not your usual cheap hotdog place . 

<root> They offer a large variety of quality hotdogs and hamburgers They also offer veggie dogs . 

<root> The fries are of good quality , the staff is friendly . 

<root> The atmosphere is your typical indie outfit with old movie posters and memorabilia from the 70's and 80's . 

<root> Over charged . 

<root> I used my card to purchase a meal on the menu and the total on my receipt was $ 8.95 but when I went on line to check my transaction it show $ 10.74 . 

<root> There is something wrong or maybe the individual made a mistake but to me that is not integrity . 

<root> Elmira , you r the best ! 

<root> All I can say is that Elmira you are the best I ve experienced , never before has the seamstress done a perfect job until i met you . 

<root> I recommend you to everyone in Calgary , as she is a professional and the cost for her was low . 

<root> 5 star detail job 

<root> I took my Mustang here and it looked amazing after they were done , they did a great job , I 'm very satisfied with the results . 

<root> The paint and wheels looked like glass and the interior looked new ! 

<root> Also , they have great customer service and a very knowledgeable staff
