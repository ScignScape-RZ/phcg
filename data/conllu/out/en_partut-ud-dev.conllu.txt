<root> You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part - session . 

<root> The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually . 

<root> Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this . 

<root> I should like to address one final point . 

<root> I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report . 

<root> I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part - session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes . 

<root> In many ways , the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another . 

<root> The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously . 

<root> Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport . 

<root> We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union . 

<root> We are badly behind now in this matter . 

<root> We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes . 

<root> The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks . 

<root> how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development ? 

<root> as far as French planning experts are concerned , for example , the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country .

<root> ( 21 ) EUPs complying with the ecodesign requirements laid down in implementing measures to this Directive should bear the " CE " marking and associated information , in order to enable them to be placed on the internal market and move freely . 

<root> and one of the workshops led to a proposal , by Member States , for a Council recommendation . 

<root> Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom , justice and peace in the world ; 

<root> ( 1 ) Everyone has the right to a nationality . 

<root> It 's that pyramid . 

<root> And what 's that ? 

<root> That top predator , of course , is us . 

<root> I love a challenge , and saving the Earth is probably a good one . 

<root> We all know the Earth is in trouble . 

<root> We have now entered in the 6 X : 

<root> the sixth major extinction on this planet . 

<root> I think that vote is occurring right now . 

<root> I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions , using fungi , and these solutions are based on mycelium . 

<root> The mycelium infuses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it 's extremely tenacious . 

<root> This holds up to 30,000 times its mass . 

<root> They 're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature - the soil magicians . 

<root> They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth . 

<root> Dusty and I , we like to say , on Sunday , this is where we go to church . 

<root> I 'm in love with the old - growth forest , and I 'm a patriotic American because we have those . 

<root> Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms . 

<root> And frankly , I face a big obstacle . 

<root> So , I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group . 

<root> We call it mycophobia , the irrational fear of the unknown , when it comes to fungi . 

<root> Mushrooms are very fast in their growth . 

<root> Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics . 

<root> In fact , we 're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom . 

<root> We share in common the same pathogens . 

<root> Fungi do not like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibiotics come from fungi . 

<root> But here is a mushroom that 's past its prime . 

<root> After they sporulate , they do rot . 

<root> But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest . 

<root> They give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium . 

<root> And so we see a mushroom here sporulating . 

<root> And the spores are germinating , and the mycelium forms and goes underground . 

<root> In a single cubic inch of soil , there can be more than eight miles of these cells . 

<root> My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium . 

<root> This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey . 

<root> And notice that as the mycelium grows , it conquers territory and then it begins the net . 

<root> We exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium . 

<root> It inhales oxygen , just like we do . 

<root> But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs . 

<root> And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes . 

<root> And in these cavities , these micro - cavities form , and as they fuse soils , they absorb water . 

<root> These are little wells . 

<root> And inside these wells , then microbial communities begin to form . 

<root> I first proposed , in the early 1990 s , that mycelium is Earth 's natural Internet . 

<root> When you look at the mycelium , they 're highly branched . 

<root> The mycelium is sentient . 

<root> It knows that you are there . 

<root> When you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris . 

<root> So , I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven , biologically successful model . 

<root> Going way out , dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype . 

<root> And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe . 

<root> Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land . 

<root> They came to land 1.3 billion years ago , and plants followed several hundred million years later . 

<root> How is that possible ? 

<root> Makes the rocks crumble , and the first step in the generation of soil . 

<root> Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together . 

<root> So , fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates . 

<root> And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix . 

<root> This was first discovered in 1859 . 

<root> This is a photograph by Franz Hueber . 

<root> This photograph 's taken 1950 s in Saudi Arabia . 

<root> 420 million years ago , this organism existed . 

<root> It was called Prototaxites . 

<root> Prototaxites , laying down , was about three feet tall . 

<root> The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet . 

<root> Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms . 

<root> All across most land masses . 

<root> And these existed for tens of millions of years . 

<root> The Earth was struck by an asteroid , a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere . 

<root> Sunlight was cut off , and fungi inherited the Earth . 

<root> Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded , because fungi do not need light . 

<root> So , the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere , I think , is a forgone conclusion ; 

<root> at least in my own mind . 

<root> The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon . 

<root> 2,200 acres in size , 2,000 years old . 

<root> The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat , one cell wall thick . 

<root> The mycelium , in the right conditions , produces a mushroom - it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt . 

<root> We were involved with several experiments . 

<root> I 'm going to show you six , if I can , solutions for helping to save the world . 

<root> Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham , Washington . 

<root> Economists at Citigroup , Mckinsey , Pricewaterhousecoopers , and elsewhere were predicting an era of broad and sustained growth from Asia to Africa . 

<root> Third , floating exchange rates are flawed shock absorbers . 

<root> It is na√Øve for emerging - market governments to expect major financial centers to adjust their policies in response to economic conditions elsewhere . 

<root> " But the bottom line is that the ideas protected by IP rights are the dynamo of growth for developed and developing countries alike . 

<root> It is time for India 's leaders to recognize the positive role that IP can play in fostering growth and improving citizens ' wellbeing . 

<root> Andy Haldane , one of the lieutenants Carney inherited at the BoE , has questioned the financial sector 's economic contribution , pointing to " its ability to both invigorate and incapacitate large parts of the non - financial economy . 

<root> The reasons for this relationship are not easy to establish definitively , and the authors ' conclusions are controversial . 

<root> These companies find it harder to recruit skilled graduates when financial firms can pay higher salaries . 

<root> But if finance continues to take a disproportionate number of the best and the brightest , there could be little British manufacturing left by 2050 , and even fewer hi-tech firms than today . 

<root> Physicists know that subatomic phenomena can manifest themselves as both particles and waves ; 

<root> America can adopt a new growth strategy ‚Äì moving away from excess consumption toward a model based on saving and investing in people , infrastructure , and capacity . 

<root> How will resources be allocated to care for the elderly , especially in slow - growing economies where existing public pension schemes and old - age health plans are patently unsustainable ? 

<root> A global carbon tax would mitigate climate risks while alleviating government debt burdens . 

<root> But when innovation affects an automobile 's quality , the task becomes far more difficult . 

<root> Women who have completed secondary or tertiary education are more likely to enter and remain in the labor market than their less educated counterparts . 

<root> Indeed , its three - year plan for economic innovation , announced in February , aims to raise the female employment rate to 62 % by 2017 , through the provision of affordable , high - quality childcare facilities and expanded paid parental leave , among other measures . 

<root> The IMF is founded on the premise that it represents cooperation between all of the countries of the world . 

<root> Next month , Ukraine 's citizens will freely choose a new President ‚Äì the best rebuke possible to Russian propaganda about our supposed failure to uphold democracy . 

<root> And there are an estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever annually , leading to 30,000 deaths worldwide . 

<root> Only with pragmatic , fact - based Regulation can the world realize genetic engineering 's full disease - fighting potential . 

<root> He is renowned for his multifaceted characters , who are morally ambiguous . 

<root> Balzac had difficulty adapting to the rote style of learning at the school . 

<root> The narrator says : 

<root> Near the end of his life Balzac was captivated by the idea of cutting 20,000 acres ( 81 Km2 ) of oak wood in Ukraine and transporting it for sale in France . 

<root> " When the idea struck , he raced to his sister 's apartment and proclaimed : 

<root> Although Balzac was a supporter of the crown , Balzac paints the counter - revolutionaries in a sympathetic light - even though they are the center of the book 's most brutal scenes . 

<root> Le Cousin Pons ( 1847 ) and La Cousine Bette ( 1848 ) tell the story of Les Parents Pauvres ( The Poor Relations ) . 

<root> Their correspondence reveals an intriguing balance of passion , propriety and patience ; 

<root> While he admired and drew inspiration from the Romantic style of Scottish novelist Walter Scott , Balzac sought to depict human existence through the use of particulars . 

<root> Some critics consider Balzac 's writing exemplary of naturalism - a more pessimistic and analytical form of realism , which seeks to explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment . 

<root> " At the same time , the characters represent a particular range of social types : 

<root> As part of the 19 th - century evolution of the novel as a " democratic literary form " , Balzac wrote that " books are written for everybody " . 

<root> At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : 

<root> " Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day , but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19 th century . 

<root> His actual date of birth remains unknown , but is traditionally observed on 23 April , Saint George 's Day . 

<root> In 1599 , a partnership of company members built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames , which they called the Globe . 

<root> Records of Shakespeare 's property purchases and investments indicate that the company made him a wealthy man . 

<root> By 1604 , he had moved north of the river again , to an area north of St Paul 's Cathedral with many fine houses . 

<root> There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy , a maker of ladies ' wigs and other headgear . 

<root> His last three plays were collaborations , probably with John Fletcher , who succeeded him as the house playwright for the King 's Men . 

<root> that is the question " . 

<root> In 1613 , Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII " was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony " . 

<root> It contained 36 texts , including 18 printed for the first time . 

<root> He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley , Earl of Southampton . 

<root> These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi , Otello and Falstaff , whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays . 

<root> In Shakespeare 's day , English grammar , spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now , and his use of language helped shape modern English . 

<root> In the 1950 s , a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for " post - modern " studies of Shakespeare . 

<root> At 18 , he married the 26 - year - old Anne Hathaway , who was pregnant . 

<root> In the late 19 th century , Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances , and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies , his term is often used .
