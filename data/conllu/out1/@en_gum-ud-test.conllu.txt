<root> The prevalence of discrimination across racial groups in contemporary America : 

<root> Results from a nationally representative sample of adults 

<root> Introduction . 

<root> Personal experiences of discrimination and bias have been the focus of much social science research . [ 1 - 3 ] 

<root> Sociologists have explored the adverse consequences of discrimination [ 3 – 5 ] ; 

<root> psychologists have examined the mental processes that underpin conscious and unconscious biases [ 6 ] ; 

<root> neuroscientists have examined the neurobiological underpinnings of discrimination [ 7 – 9 ] ; 

<root> and evolutionary theorists have explored the various ways that in-group / out-group biases emerged across the history of our species . [ 10 ] 

<root> In many respects , researchers already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias . [ 11 ] 

<root> What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices . 

<root> Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings , for example , are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members . [ 12 ] 

<root> Indeed , the implementation of certain policies is rooted in the assumption that discrimination and biases are , at least to some appreciable amount , present in modern society . 

<root> Even so , estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare ( see [ 13 – 14 ] ) . 

<root> At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [ 15 ] , however , using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample , reported that approximately 33 % of respondents reported some form of discrimination ( see also , Gibbons et al. [ 4 ] ) . 

<root> The current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large , nationally representative sample of adults from the United States . 

<root> Additionally , the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences . 

<root> Reason for discrimination . 

<root> All respondents who indicated they were discriminated against — specifically , those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above — were asked the following question : 

<root> “ What do you think was the main reason for these experiences ? ” 

<root> Respondents were allowed to choose one response from 11 categories . 

<root> For the present analysis , these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories capturing the following options : 

<root> race / ancestry / skin color ; 

<root> gender ; 

<root> age ; 

<root> religion ; 

<root> height or weight ; 

<root> sexual orientation ; 

<root> education or income ; 

<root> physical disability ; 

<root> and other . 

<root> The following categories from the original questionnaire were collapsed into one category for the analysis : race ; ancestry or national origin ; and shade of skin color . 

<root> Additionally , because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences , the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing ( legitimate skip ) . 

<root> Respondent race . 

<root> Because a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews , we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interview . 

<root> Wave 1 race — rather than , say , Wave 3 race — was used to preserve case counts . 

<root> The logic is that ( nearly ) all Wave 4 respondents appeared in the Wave 1 sample , but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3 due to differential patterns of temporary attrition . 

<root> Respondents were asked to indicate their race from among the following categories : White ; Black or African American ; Hispanic ; American Indian or Native American ; and Asian or Pacific Islander . 

<root> Respondents were provided the opportunity to select more than one race , and those who did were asked a follow-up question regarding which category best described their racial background . 

<root> In the current study , those respondents who indicated more than one race were coded as “ mixed race ” . 

<root> Demographic variables . 

<root> To provide information on the analytical sample as a whole , two additional demographic variables are included . 

<root> First , age is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents ' birth ( obtained from Wave 1 ) from the year of the interview at Wave 4 . 

<root> Second , sex was dichotomously coded based on the self-reported sex of the respondent at Wave 4 ( 0 = female and 1 = male ) . 

<root> Analytical plan . 

<root> Our exploratory study included three basic steps . 

<root> First , summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were produced . 

<root> Second , we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category . 

<root> Finally , we assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categories . 

<root> In order to examine potential bivariate associations , the adjusted F statistic ( design-based F ) was employed as it corrects for a complex sample design such as that used in the Add Health . [ 21 ] 

<root> More specifically , when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “ an F statistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott ( 1981 [ 22 ] , 1984 [ 23 ] ) correction ” . [ 24 ] 

<root> The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate ( than the associated with the χ2 statistic ) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data . 

<root> This final step also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discrimination . 

<root> As noted earlier , all analyses were weighted according to the survey weight provided by the Add Health research staff and standard errors were corrected for the clustering and stratification that defined the sampling strategy . 

<root> Thus , all estimates reported here can be considered nationally representative of the United States . 

<root> 2. GUJJOLAAY EEGIMAA , ITS SPEAKERS AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS 

<root> This section briefly presents the Gújjolaay Eegimaa ( Eegimaa for short ; Ethnologue code : ISO 639-3 : bqj ) , its speakers and its varieties . 

<root> We also discuss aspects of the contact situation of the Eegimaa language . 

<root> This is important , because as we will show in § 6 below , some of the Eegimaa death prevention names and child-bearing names are given to Eegimaa people from other communities . 

<root> Eegimaa is a Jóola language spoken in the Basse Casamance area of Southern Senegal by a population estimated to be between 7,000 ( Bassène , 2007 ) and 11,200 speakers ( Lewis , Simons , & Fennig , 2014 ) . 

<root> Jóola languages are classified as members of Sapir ’s ( 1971 ) BAK group of Atlantic languages of the Niger Congo language phylum . 

<root> Speakers of these languages are found in the Gambia , in the former Casamance region of Southern Senegal and in Guinea Bissau . 

<root> The map in Figure 1 , taken from Ethnologue , presents the languages of Senegal . 

<root> The arrow on the map points to the Eegimaa speaking area ( Bandial is the name used by Ethnologue for Eegimaa ) . 

<root> Eegimaa is mainly spoken in Mof-Ávvi , a former kingdom of 10 villages located to the west of Ziguinchor , the capital city of the former administrative region of Casamance in the south of Senegal . 

<root> Mof-Ávvi is a peninsula bordered by the Casamance River to the north , which separates it from the Jóola Búluf and Jóola Fogny areas , and to the east by the villages Brin and Djibonker , where the speakers of Kujireray and Baïnounk Gubëeher live . 

<root> In the south , the river known as Kamobeul Bolon separates Mof-Ávvi from the Bayot speaking area , while the west side of Mof-Ávvi coincides with the homeland of the Jóola Kaasa Húluf and Jóola Kaasa Ésuulaaluʔ . 

<root> The map in Figure 2 below , adapted from Palmeri and Gazio ( 1995 ) , shows a very approximate location of Mof-Ávvi in relation to other neighbouring speech communities . 

<root> Some of these communities will be referred to in our discussion of death prevention names in § 6 . 

<root> The Eegimaa spoken in Mof-Ávvi is known by several names given by speakers of neighbouring languages . 

<root> For example , the name Kusiilay 1 ‘ the language of Essil ’ , is the name given by speakers of Kujireray to the Eegimaa language , because Essil , of which Bajjat was a district , is the village which has a border with their village . 

<root> Endungo is the name given by Bayot speakers , but its meaning is not known . 

<root> Kúlaakiay , ‘ the language of village of Seleki / Sállagi ’ , is the name given by Jóola Kaasa speakers who are more familiar with the village of Seleki / Sállagi ’ than all other villages of Mof-Ávvi . 

<root> Finally , Banjal / Bandial ‘ the language of the village of Banjal ’ , the most popular of all those names , is the name given by the Jóola Búluf and Jóola Fogny speakers to Eegimaa people and their language , because people from the village of Banjal were the first to be in contact with them .

<root> Map of the Eegimaa speaking area 

<root> Village names are written using their usual spelling . 

<root> The Ethnologue language codes are provided for language varieties that have them . 

<root> Language names are written following the recommendation for the transcription of national languages of Senegal , Decree 2005-981 . 

<root> Names of the villages of Mof-Ávvi are written using the Eegimaa orthography and following the pronunciation of village names by native speakers . 

<root> Jóola language varieties which are closely related to Eegimaa include Kujireray / Kuluunaay ( from the village of Brin with 76 % lexical similarity ) and Gufiñamay ( from the village of Afiniam with 74 % lexical similarity ( based on Lewis et al. , 2014 eds. ) ) . 

<root> Gútaamay ( from the village of Butam ) , Gulapaoray ( from the village Djilapaor ) and Gusiilay ( ISO 639-3 : bsl ) from the village of Thionk Essil are also other languages related to Eegimaa . 

<root> They are located north of the Casamance River in the Jóola Búluf area . 

<root> There are also small migrant Eegimaa communities in villages like Djifanghor ( east of Ziguinchor ) and in Bourofaye ( south of Ziguinchor ) , where they cohabit with speakers of Baïnounk languages . 

<root> Nowadays most Eegimaa speakers from Mof-Ávvi live outside their homeland , generally in urban areas like Ziguinchor and Dakar . 

<root> Speakers of Eegimaa use the term Gújjolaay ( meaning Jóola ) to refer to their language when they speak to each other , but Eegimaa to distinguish their Jóola variety from that of other Jóola peoples . 

<root> Eegimaa is an endangered language whose transmission to new generations has been declining significantly in the last decades . 

<root> It is important to understand the contact situation of Eegimaa , because some of the ritual names analysed in this paper come from other languages or from neighbouring communities . 

<root> These names are given either in Eegimaa or in a different language . 

<root> Antonín Dvořák 

<root> Antonín Leopold Dvořák ( / d(ə)ˈvɔːrʒɑːk , -ʒæk / d(ə)-VOR-zha(h)k ; Czech : [ ˈantoɲiːn ˈlɛopolt ˈdvor̝aːk ] ; 8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904 ) was a Czech composer . 

<root> After Bedřich Smetana , he was the next Czech Romantic-era composer to achieve worldwide recognition . 

<root> Following Smetana 's nationalist example , Dvořák frequently employed aspects , specifically rhythms , of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia . 

<root> Dvořák 's own style has been described as " the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition , absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them " . [ 1 ] 

<root> Antonín Dvořák 

<root> Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age , being an apt violin student from age six . 

<root> The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and , with special success , in 1873 , when he was aged 31 . 

<root> Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area , he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany , but did not win , and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later . 

<root> In 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition , including scores of two further symphonies and other works . 

<root> Although Dvořák was not aware of it , Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed . 

<root> The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 [ a ] and again in 1876 and in 1877 , when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick , also a member of the jury , made themselves known to him . 

<root> Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher , Simrock , who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances , Op. 46 . 

<root> These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878 , the sheet music ( of the original piano 4-hands version ) had excellent sales , and Dvořák 's international reputation was launched at last . 

<root> Dvořák 's first piece of a religious nature , his setting of Stabat Mater , was premiered in Prague in 1880 . 

<root> It was very successfully performed in London in 1883 , leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States . [ 2 ] 

<root> In his career , Dvořák made nine invited visits to England , often conducting performances of his own works . 

<root> His Seventh Symphony was written for London . 

<root> Visiting Russia in March 1890 , he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg . [ 3 ] 

<root> In 1891 Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory . 

<root> In 1890 – 91 , he wrote his Dumky Trio , one of his most successful chamber music pieces . 

<root> In 1892 , Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City . 

<root> While in the United States , Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works : the Symphony From the New World , which spread his reputation worldwide , [ 4 ] and his Cello Concerto , one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti . 

<root> He also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music , the American String Quartet , during this time . 

<root> But shortfalls in payment of his salary , along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness , led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895 . 

<root> All of Dvořák 's nine operas but his first have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit , as were some of his choral works . 

<root> By far the most successful of the operas is Rusalka . 

<root> Among his smaller works , the seventh Humoresque and the song " Songs My Mother Taught Me " are also widely performed and recorded . 

<root> He has been described as " arguably the most versatile ... composer of his time " . [ 5 ] 

<root> Otto Jespersen 

<root> Jens Otto Harry Jespersen or Otto Jespersen ( Danish : [ ʌtˢo ˈjɛsb̥ɐsn̩ ] ; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943 ) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language . 

<root> Early life 

<root> Otto Jespersen was born in Randers in Jutland . 

<root> He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy , and with the help of Rask 's grammars taught himself some Icelandic , Italian , and Spanish . 

<root> He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17 , initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies . 

<root> In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages , and in 1887 earned his master 's degree in French , with English and Latin as his secondary languages . 

<root> He supported himself during his studies through part-time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament . 

<root> In 1887 – 1888 , he traveled to England , Germany and France , meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford University . 

<root> Following the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen , he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case system . 

<root> He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891 . 

<root> Academic life and work 

<root> Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925 , and served as Rector of the university in 1920 – 21 . 

<root> His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics , but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development . 

<root> He advanced the theories of Rank and Nexus in Danish in two papers : Sprogets logik ( 1913 ) and De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser ( 1921 ) . 

<root> Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax , and differentiates between primaries , secondaries , and tertiaries ; e.g. in " well honed phrase , " " phrase " is a primary , this being defined by a secondary , " honed " , which again is defined by a tertiary " well " . 

<root> The term Nexus is applied to sentences , structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation , in which two concepts are expressed in one unit ; e.g. , it rained , he ran indoors . 

<root> This term is qualified by a further concept called a junction which represents one idea , expressed by means of two or more elements , whereas a nexus combines two ideas . 

<root> Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics . 

<root> He was most widely recognized for some of his books . 

<root> Language : Its Nature , Development and Origin ( 1922 ) is considered by many to be his masterpiece . 

<root> Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles ( 1909 – 1949 ) , concentrated on morphology and syntax , and Growth and Structure of the English Language ( 1905 ) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language , and still in print , over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication . 

<root> Late in his life he published Analytic Syntax ( 1937 ) , in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation . 

<root> In The Philosophy of Grammar ( 1924 ) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in Grammar and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of grammatical case , pronoun , object , voice etc. , and developed further his notions of Rank and Nexus . 

<root> In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern Structural linguistics . 

<root> Mankind , Nation and Individual : from a linguistic point of view ( 1925 ) is one of the pioneering works on Sociolinguistics . 

<root> Jespersen visited the United States twice : 

<root> he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904 , and in 1909 – 1910 he visited both the University of California and Columbia University . 

<root> While in the U.S. , he took occasion to study the country 's educational system . 

<root> His autobiography ( see below ) was published in English translation as recently as 1995 . 

<root> Jespersen was a proponent of phonosemanticism and wrote : 

<root> “ Is there really much more logic in the opposite extreme which denies any kind of sound symbolism ( apart from the small class of evident echoisms and ‘ onomatopoeia ’ ) and sees in our words only a collection of accidental and irrational associations of sound and meaning ? ... 

<root> There is no denying that there are words which we feel instinctively to be adequate to express the ideas they stand for . ” 

<root> After his retirement in 1925 , Jespersen remained active in the international linguistic community . 

<root> In addition to continuing to write , he convened and chaired the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Geneva in 1930 , and acted as president of the Fourth International Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936 . 

<root> Jespersen was an important figure in the international language movement . 

<root> He was an early supporter of the Esperanto offshoot Ido and in 1927 published his own project Novial . 

<root> He also worked with the International Auxiliary Language Association . 

<root> Jespersen received honorary degrees from Columbia University in New York ( 1910 ) , St. Andrews University in Scotland ( 1925 ) , and the Sorbonne in Paris ( 1927 ) . 

<root> He was one of the first six international scholars to be elected as honorary members of the Linguistic Society of America . 

<root> Falling 

<root> You ’re on the 236th-level Kaiserstrasse moving sidewalk when you see her . 

<root> You ’re leaning on the railing , waiting to ask Derya about a job , watching the glittering stream of mites that arc over half the sky — flying up to rewind their nanosprings in the stratospheric sunlight , flying down to make Frankfurt run . 

<root> You never get tired of watching them . 

<root> She ’s on the Holbeinsteg bridge . 

<root> Someone ’s hung it up here — a hundred meters of clean gray and green twentieth-century modernism , plucked up from the river Main and suspended in the chilly air 2,360 meters up , between a lump of wooded parkland and a cluster of antique subway cars . 

<root> She ’s wearing a 1950s sundress and a broad-brimmed hat , and it ’s like an essay on the last century — the austere steel bridge , the bright blobs of subway graffiti , and her yellow dress , flapping against her legs as she climbs over the bridge ’s rail . 

<root> A picture of elegance and style from the age of money , violence , and simplicity . 

<root> She ’s a strawberry blonde , slim , her skin blank and virginal as new butter . 

<root> She ’s beyond the rail now , hanging out over the mountain - high drop . 

<root> Thin translucent shadows move across her — the shadows of the neosilk-and-nanotube filaments that hang the city from the hundreds of five-kilometer-high towers that encircle it . 

<root> ( A civic agent notices you noticing , and attaches itself to your infospace , whispering statistics — 

<root> “ Each object ’s suspension must weather a class 5 hurricane and the destruction of 80 % of the towers ” — 

<root> “ Frankfurt ’s current population is stable at 53 million ” — 

<root> “ Average age 62 , birth rate 0.22 , net immigration of half a million a year ” — 

<root> “ Current personal squatright : 311 cubic meters per resident ” — 

<root> until you brush it away . ) 

<root> You ’re watching her lean out . 

<root> The wind whips her hair , ruffles the skirt around her knees . 

<root> She must be a tourist . 

<root> You remember your first trip to the upper levels : leaning over the edge into the angry swarm of mites , whirring and buzzing warnings and shoving you back like a million mosquito chaperones . 

<root> Everyone tries it once — Except that there are n’t any mites around her . 

<root> You clutch the railing . 

<root> Hot , animal fear surges in your chest . 

<root> She looks up at you and , across the gap of forty meters , smiles a brilliant , heartbreaking smile . 

<root> Then she lets go and falls . 

<root> You scream . 

<root> “ Fucking airsurfers , ” says Derya . 

<root> He steps off the moving sidewalk near you : tall , hook-nosed , the fashionable whorls of pox and acne making constellations of his cheeks and chest ; the glowing , formal tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive triceps . 

<root> You swallow on a dry throat . 

<root> Derya , of all people , hearing you scream ! 

<root> He gives you a hooded look . 

<root> “ They infect themselves with some designer virus - 

<root> it lets them hack the city ’s person-recognition systems . 

<root> So the mites do n’t see them when they jump . 

<root> Watch — ” 

<root> She ’s swept past the whalelike oval of the public pool on the 202nd , past the sloping mandala of the Google of offices on the 164th . 

<root> At the 131st , below her , is the old Stock Exchange , hung upside-down now as a hipster den . 

<root> Now the mites are finally closing in . 

<root> A silver swarm coalesces around the 164th , and she vanishes into it , like a snip of scallion into cloudy miso soup . 

<root> When the cloud disperses , she ’s standing on one of the Stock Exchange ’s upside-down overhangs . 

<root> She waves , antlike , then crawls through a dormer window . 

<root> “ It ’s not funny , ” Derya says . 

<root> “ They ’re a huge drain on emergency preparedness . 

<root> Ripple effects are causing project slowdowns ... ” 

<root> “ Freeloaders drive systemic evolution , ” you find yourself saying . 

<root> “ Do n’t you quote the founders at me , ” Derya snaps . 

<root> “ The Free Society is fragile . 

<root> The minute enough people find anticontributive behavior cool , the party ’s over — 

<root> it ’s back to capitalist competition or state control . ” 

<root> He stares until you meet his eye . 

<root> “ You even talk to those people - 

<root> are you paying attention ? — 

<root> you even talk to them , your rep will be trashed on all the major servers . 

<root> You wo n’t work , you wo n’t party , you ’ll be defriended by every one of your tribes . 

<root> Got it ? ” 

<root> Her broad-brimmed hat is still sailing on the wind . 

<root> The mites missed it . 

<root> It cuts between the towers of the 50th . 

<root> The upside-down trading floor is deserted . 

<root> There are heaps of yellowed euros and deutschmarks dumped here , like snowdrifts . 

<root> Wood panel , marble . 

<root> Silence . 

<root> And the air is strangely clear . 

<root> You realize : no mites . 

<root> The city has no eyes or ears here . 

<root> You walk through empty , miteless rooms , stepping around light fixtures . 

<root> Then she ’s there , in a doorway . 

<root> Her eyes , bright blue , radiant . 

<root> Her smile , with that chaste yellow dress , so bashful . 

<root> She comes to you . 

<root> “ You want it ? ” she says . 

<root> “ You want to be infected ? 

<root> You want to fly ? ” 

<root> You nod . 

<root> Eyes closing , she leans in for the kiss . 

<root> Perfect Teeth 

<root> Steven wanted to be a dentist . 

<root> It was pretty much the first thing he told us when , as first years , we were all bunched together in the unfamiliar dusty classroom . 

<root> When , a couple of weeks later we were invited over to his house we saw that this was not an idle remark . 

<root> Where our bedroom walls were decorated with posters of pop stars and footballers , Steven had diagrams setting out tooth implementations , anatomical drawings of the jaw with brightly coloured nerves , muscle , blood vessels , bones , and , of course , teeth . 

<root> Where we had shelves of plastic dinosaurs and superhero figurines from cornflake boxes , Steven had plaster casts of jawbones , gums and teeth grinning down at us . 

<root> The instruments were locked away in glass cabinets and only his parents had the key . 

<root> “ They do n’t exactly encourage my interest , ” he shrugged . 

<root> “ They sort of tolerate it . 

<root> But Dad says they ’re a sort of collection , and too expensive for me to play with . ” 

<root> Of course , we tried to pick the locks , but the spikes and saws and drillheads remained — tantalisingly — out of reach . 

<root> We did n’t see Steven ’s interest as strange , well , not that much . 

<root> We all had our own interests — drawing , electronics , collecting beer caps — that each appeared obscure to anyone else . 

<root> DIY Dentistry was just something that had never crossed our horizon before . 

<root> And if Steven did n’t see it as weird , or no weirder than Andy showing us his Eastern-Block beer caps all laid out neatly on cork boards with little hand-written labels , why should it bother us ? 

<root> I suppose that , in our own way , we were all collectively strange . 

<root> The bunch that no one picked for their side at football or hockey , and that was the glue that held us together . 

<root> Besides , Steven had some really good stuff : sweets that stained your teeth bright red — well , technically , not your teeth , just the plaque , but the result was often the same . 

<root> It took a few days good brushing to get it off . 

<root> Well , most of it anyway . 

<root> He had effervescent tablets that turned the canteen drinking water into that exact same pink mixture that the dentist gave you to rinse your mouth out after scraping around inside , and guaranteed to make the other kids splutter and spit it out when the taste slowly percolated through and met the memory of their last checkup . 

<root> Then there was the event that became the rite of passage into our group of misfits and outcasts : making a mould of your teeth . 

<root> It was inevitable that one of us , seeing the plaster casts on the shelf by Steven ’s bed would ask how they were done . 

<root> It was just as inevitable that a few minutes later , Steven would be mixing up various powders and liquids , and pouring them into a horse-shoe shaped contraption . 

<root> It was n’t dangerous . 

<root> At least , I suppose so . 

<root> It was vaguely uncomfortable , and appeared sufficiently disturbing that we all volunteered each other in turn until , at last , Andy said he was game . 

<root> And we were off . 

<root> The hardest part was probably to overcome the gagging reflex that set in when you bit down into the acrid resin jelly and it flowed out and up and around , over teeth , gums and tongue . 

<root> Your nose filled with what you imagined were fumes from the warm paste . 

<root> And you seemed to be suddenly drowning in your own saliva . 

<root> Things generally got better when Steven reminded you that you could actually breathe , and swallow , normally . 

<root> He watched the second hand trotting round the dial of his watch mouthing the quarters , before poking the setting goo to check its consistency . 

<root> Then , when he gave you the nod , you tried to prise your jaws apart . 

<root> As the seal around your gums and teeth was pretty solid , you thought it would never come off , as the others giggled at your expressions and grimaces . 

<root> Steven jiggled the handle that stuck out beyond your front teeth like some metallic duck ’s bill , turning and twisting it most professionally and murmuring encouragements . 

<root> And , then , with an awful sucking slurp , it came free . 

<root> The initiated then revelled in retelling the gross sensation of having this evil-smelling plastic slug invade your mouth , while the others waited their turn with mixed trepidation and excitement . 

<root> Raucous laughter greeted the suggestions of the other body parts that could receive the same treatment . 

<root> The next part of the proceedings was less thrilling . 

<root> Steven measured and mixed the plaster of Paris and prepared for the cast by using a bright blue putty to build up the form of the jaw , and shoring up gaps and holes . 

<root> It get even less exciting when he said we ’d have to wait an hour while the plaster set real solid . 

<root> But the next time we visited his room we got to marvel at our toothy grins labelled and lined up on the shelf . 

<root> We were all perfectly happy with the result , even wanting one as a trophy until Steven passed an expert eye over them , pointing out here a gap , here a filling , and there a completely misaligned incisor . 

<root> We were , he told us , mediocre specimens for his collection . 

<root> It did n’t matter . 

<root> We were all friends , a group bonded by the common experience of being able to see our teeth on Steven ’s shelf . 

<root> Wikinews interviews Christopher Hill , U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate 

<root> Interview 

<root> What qualifications do you have that will assist you in executing the duties of president ? 

<root> My Presidential qualifications are rooted in my service as an Officer in the United States Air Force . 

<root> I took the Oath to our Constitution at 22 years old . 

<root> I understood it was an Oath to ALL of our people . 

<root> Politicians profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their voters . 

<root> As President , I will serve ALL of the people in America , guided by the Constitution . 

<root> Why run for president ? 

<root> Why not run for a lower office that you would be more likely to win and effect change ? 

<root> When I was a young man in Air Force ROTC I was chosen to attend a unique Pilot Training Program called Euro- NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training . 

<root> The Air Force only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy , Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attend . 

<root> I volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the " Top of the Spear . " 

<root> In those days it was all or nothing . 

<root> If you graduated you were assigned a fighter , if you were not quite fighter pilot material you had no response to fly another aircraft , you were washed out . 

<root> Congress has proven itself ineffective as a body . 

<root> To make a difference in America you must have the " Bully Pulpit " and speak to the People . 

<root> The President has that pulpit . 

<root> All or nothing . 

<root> I never wanted to make politics a career . 

<root> Why did you choose to run in the Republican Party ? 

<root> My ties to the Republican party date back to 1979 , when I volunteered for Ronald Reagan and his campaign in New Hampshire . 

<root> In those days I believed there was a difference in the parties . 

<root> Today , like many Americans , I am skeptical . 

<root> I understand third party candidates have no success . 

<root> I hope to lead the Republican party in a new direction for working class Americans . 

<root> How do you plan to get into the Republican debates and make an impact on polls ? 

<root> In order to be invited to the debates , we must raise money and poll nationally . 

<root> This is an effort that is underway . 

<root> Recently we were listed in New Hampshire and nationally with Politics1 . 

<root> If you do not receive the Republican nomination , would you consider running as a third party candidate ? 

<root> No , I will back the nominee of the Republican party in 2016 . 

<root> After that , I may reconsider . 

<root> Other than yourself , which candidates have you supported for president in previous campaigns ? 

<root> Reagan in 80 and 84 , [ George H. W. ] Bush in 88 and 92 , [ Phil ] Gramm in 96 , [ George W. ] Bush in 2000 and , Romney in 08 . 

<root> What are your thoughts on the job Barack Obama has done as president ? 

<root> Specifically , what would you have done differently ? 

<root> President Obama has an agenda that represents the far left wing of his party . 

<root> His use of the Presidency to further this agenda has in many ways been unconstitutional . 

<root> Specifically , altering law once it is passed to accommodate his voting blocs . 

<root> His direction to Eric Holder to enforce some laws and not others is another example . 

<root> Hill at the Lesser-known candidates forum in 2011 

<root> If elected , what would constitute a successful presidency for you ? 

<root> Achieving four goals : 

<root> Term Limits for Congress and the Courts returning government to the People . 

<root> Implementing a Tax System that allows working Americans making under $ 250,000 to keep all of their money . 

<root> Closing Loopholes and putting in place a system that is transparent and works . 

<root> Passing a Living Wage program lifting people out of poverty . 

<root> Returning America to a state of Peace and Security . 

<root> What individuals would you like to see in a Hill administration ? 

<root> I would like to bring People from the heartland of America that make this nation work . 

<root> We have had too many decades of Ivy League elites and Professors immersed in theory . 

<root> Hill ( right ) with fellow 2012 presidential candidate Buddy Roemer . 

<root> Anything else you would like to add ? 

<root> A final thought . 

<root> America is a nation that will endure . 

<root> I believe it is our responsibility to pass on the same opportunities to future generations that were promised to us . 

<root> As President , I intend to keep that promise ! 

<root> Wikinews interviews Robert Sarvis , Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Virginia 

<root> Saturday , October 19 , 2013 

<root> Attorney Robert Sarvis , the Libertarian Party 's nominee for Governor of Virginia , answered five questions submitted via e-mail by accredited Wikinews reporter William Saturn . 

<root> Sarvis has garnered double digits in opinion polls for the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election , an unusual feat for a third party candidate . 

<root> The latest Newsmax / Zogby poll from late September placed him at 13 percent , 14 points behind Republican Party nominee Ken Cuccinelli , Virginia 's Attorney General , and 19 points behind Democratic Party nominee Terry McAuliffe , the former Democratic National Committee chairman , with 24 percent undecided . 

<root> Whoever wins election on November 5 , 2013 , would replace outgoing governor Bob McDonnell . 

<root> On his campaign website , Sarvis notes he favors parental school choice through student vouchers , simplification of Virginia 's Tax Code , US Second Amendment - gun - rights , same-sex marriage , and reform of the state 's drug laws . 

<root> With Wikinews , Sarvis discusses his background , views on McDonnell 's tenure , keys to campaign success , plan to implement his agenda , and the former Virginia governor he most admires . 

<root> Interview 

<root> What is the most important aspect of your background that voters should know about ? 

<root> I am the only candidate born and raised in Virginia , but also the only candidate who embodies both physically and philosophically the growing diversity of the commonwealth . 

<root> ( I am mixed-race ( half-Chinese ) and in an interracial marriage . ) 

<root> I am the only candidate who has studied both economics and law , and the only candidate with a background in technology entrepreneurship . 

<root> Because of my academic and professional background , I understand the issues and challenges facing Virginia much better than the other candidates , and I am offering real solutions that can be appreciated across the political spectrum . 

<root> I am the only candidate who believes in both economic freedom and personal liberty and the only candidate who stands on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law . 

<root> What are your thoughts on the job Bob McDonnell has done as Governor of Virginia ? 

<root> What would you have done differently than him ? 

<root> McDonnell did well early in his term pushing back against Senate Democrats who wanted huge tax increases in response to major revenue shortfalls during the recession . 

<root> Those early budget efforts are his highest achievements as Governor . 

<root> More recently , he erred in accepting a transportation bill that had huge flaws and huge tax increases , rather than prioritizing spending and seeking more rational , efficient , decentralized transportation decision-making . 

<root> He could have shown much greater leadership in pushing for tax reform , regulatory reform , and school choice . 

<root> Of course , he showed ethical lapses in judgment . 

<root> Compared to previous third party candidates at the gubernatorial level , you have done exceptionally well in opinion polling . 

<root> What do you attribute that success to ? 

<root> Voters see the two-party system for the sham it has become . 

<root> They are sick of the partisanship and nonsense and the total lack of substance in modern campaigns . 

<root> Voters see the two major party nominees as exemplifying what is worst about their respective parties , and they want something better . 

<root> Voters who meet me and hear me speak know that I am sincere , know that I understand the issues deeply and have workable solutions , and know that I stand on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law and the public interest . 

<root> People like the fact that I stand for a Virginia that is both Open-minded and Open for Business . 

<root> If elected governor , how will you be able to implement your agenda while dealing with a hostile legislature ? 

<root> There are precedents of independent governors dealing effectively with the legislature , and indeed a wise third-party governor can have greater effectiveness than a major party governor . 

<root> Libertarians share many policy positions with each of the major parties . 

<root> Working together with both Republicans and Democrats , we can get the good aspects of each party while rejecting the bad parts of both . 

<root> Moreover , electing a third-party governor represents a repudiation of politics as usual , and the major party legislators will face changed constraints and incentives , meaning that much more is possible than many people assume , especially with strong leadership . 

<root> Which previous Virginia Governor(s) do you most admire and why ? 

<root> Thomas Jefferson . 

<root> He was incredibly learned and was a strong advocate for freedom and the rule of law . 

<root> He would be a Libertarian today .

<root> Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire 

<root> Sunday , May 28 , 2006 

<root> The LibriVox website features a catalog of about a hundred completed books , including books in other languages like German , Hebrew , and Japanese . 

<root> Why did you decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands , and how did you go about it ? 

<root> I think that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world , and so I thought : here 's a way to help the cause . 

<root> I launched LibriVox , emailed some friends and some podcasters who where doing literary stuff , and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad 's Secret Agent . 

<root> Things have grown steadily since . 

<root> By the way , AKMA was the first guy I know of to do something like this , with Lawrence Lessig 's Free Culture . 

<root> That , I think , started my thinking about this , but it took a while for the idea to crystallize . 

<root> Hugh McGuire with some books that have not yet been acoustically liberated . 

<root> Do you personally record audiobooks , and did you already do so before LibriVox ? 

<root> LibriVox was my first experience recording audiobooks . 

<root> I still do the odd chapter , but i am a bit delinquent in finishing some of them these days ! 

<root> Is there a particular LibriVox book which you think stands out because of the quality , the overall effort involved , its popularity , or for some other reason ? 

<root> My personal favourite is Notes from the Underground ( Dostoyevsky ) . 

<root> Other random good ones : 

<root> Austen , Jane . 

<root> Pride and Prejudice 

<root> Christie , Agatha . 

<root> The Mysterious Affair at Styles 

<root> London , Jack . 

<root> White Fang 

<root> Macaulay , Thomas Babington . 

<root> History of England ( Volume 1 , Chapter 1 ) 

<root> Marx , Karl and Engels , Friedrich . 

<root> The Communist Manifesto ( solo ) 

<root> Twain , Mark . 

<root> A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court ( solo ) 

<root> Ed. : See the LibriVox catalog for a full index . 

<root> Browsing the catalog , I find that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter . 

<root> If someone wanted to re-record a chapter because they did n't like the speaker , would you then offer two versions ? 

<root> Yes . 

<root> We take the Wikipedia approach : if you think it should be better , please help it be so . 

<root> You 'll note we offer a couple of versions of some books . 

<root> Indeed our weekly poetry project celebrates this diversity of voice : each week a new short poem is chosen and as many readers as wish to record a version , so you get 20 + versions of the same poem , a very interesting audio experience . 

<root> Besides works whose copyright has expired , there is an increasing number of modern books available under Creative Commons and similar licenses . 

<root> You mentioned Larry Lessig 's Free Culture , but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers who are open to the concept , such as O'Reilly . 

<root> Do you want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works , or do you have plans to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well ? 

<root> We are only doing public domain works , for a number of reasons , partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation -- public domain means it s as simple as can be . 

<root> CC makes things more complex . 

<root> Also , there are other sites , notably podiobooks.com , which are better suited to CC works than LibriVox . 

<root> we find it makes things clear and easy to say : published works , public domain , and leave it at that . 

<root> As far as I can tell , podiobooks.com features " free as in beer " content — material which you can download , but which is n't under a free content license . 

<root> Instead of " public domain " , would n't " free content " work just as well , using something like the Free Content Definition to limit the scope ? 

<root> This needs more discussion obviously : we chose public domain because the texts we use are public domain and we did n't want to add new restrictions , especially not non-commercial , since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects ( I ca n't recall any specific project names , but some pay-education sites use LV stuff ) . 

<root> That 's good and well and fine with us . 

<root> We do n't want to have to give anyone permission to use our recordings , we want anyone to use them for whatever they want . 

<root> Also , for the thing to work you need to have many dedicated volunteers willing to do the management ( onerous ) and many willing to do the reading . 

<root> While Pride and Prejudice will attract many readers , I do n't know about O'Reilly 's latest tome on XML ... though I might be wrong . 

<root> Pop culture celebrated at Fan Expo Canada 2016 in Toronto 

<root> Wednesday , September 7 , 2016 

<root> The far end of part of the convention floor , shortly after opening Friday .

<root> NASA celebrates 30th anniversary of first shuttle launch ; announces new homes for retired shuttles 

<root> Wednesday , April 13 , 2011 

<root> NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announces where four space shuttle orbiters will be permanently displayed at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle Program during an event commemorating the 30th anniversay of the first shuttle launch on April 12 , 2011 . 

<root> Image : NASA Bill Ingalls . 

<root> NASA celebrated the launch of the first space shuttle Tuesday at an event at the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) in Cape Canaveral , Florida . 

<root> On April 12 , 1981 , Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center on STS-1 , the first space shuttle mission . 

<root> NASA held a ceremony commemorating the date outside the hangar , known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1 , for Space Shuttle Atlantis , which is being prepped for its final mission which will be STS-135 , which will be the last Space Shuttle mission . 

<root> At the ceremony , NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announced the locations that would be given the three remaining Space Shuttle orbiters following the end of the Space Shuttle program . 

<root> The prototype orbiter , Space Shuttle Enterprise would be relocated from the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City . 

<root> Space Shuttle Discovery will take the place of Enterprise at the Udvar-Hazy Center . 

<root> Discovery has already been retired following the completion of STS-133 last month , its 39th mission . 

<root> Discovery is undergoing decommissioning and currently being prepped for display by removing toxic materials from the orbiter . 

<root> Looking back : Space Shuttle Columbia lifts off on STS-1 from Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on April 12 , 1981 . 

<root> Image : NASA . 

<root> Space Shuttle Endeavour , which will launch on STS-134 at the end of the month on April 29 , will be sent to the California Science Center in Los Angeles , California following its retirement . 

<root> Finally , Atlantis will go on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex following the orbiter 's last flight which launches June 28 . 

<root> Columbia was lost tragically back on February 1 , 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry killing all seven astronauts aboard . 

<root> Space Shuttle Challenger was lost when it exploded 73 seconds after liftoff back on January 28 , 1986 killing all six aboard . 

<root> " We want to thank all of the locations that expressed an interest in one of these national treasures , " said Bolden to the gathered crowd which contained many KSC employees . 

<root> " This was a very difficult decision , but one that was made with the American public in mind . 

<root> In the end , these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA 's remarkable Space Shuttle Program . 

<root> These facilities we 've chosen have a noteworthy legacy of preserving space artifacts and providing outstanding access to U.S. and international visitors . " 

<root> This was a very difficult decision , but one that was made with the American public in mind .

<root> Charles Bolden , NASA Administrator 

<root> File image of Space Shuttle Atlantis lifting off , which approaches its last mission before retirement . 

<root> Image : NASA . 

<root> Not all were pleased with the final choice of locations . 

<root> U.S. Senator John Cornyn , Republican from Texas , issued a statement regarding the rejection of Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) in Houston , Texas as a location . 

<root> " Like many Texans , I am disappointed with NASA 's decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the Space Shuttle Orbiters . 

<root> Houston has played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle , but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet . " 

<root> Cornyn 's statement added , " There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters — even Administrator Bolden stated as much . 

<root> Today 's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center , the greater Houston community and the State of Texas , and I m deeply disappointed with the Administration 's misguided decision . “ 

<root> However , the JSC will recieve pilot and commander seats from the flight deck . 

<root> The Museum of Flight in Seattle , Washington was also proposed as another location for a shuttle , going so far as to build a new building to house an orbiter . 

<root> In a statement , Governor of Washington Chris Gregoire said , " The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest . 

<root> As the home of modern day air travel and the 747 , which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years , Seattle would have been a perfect fit . 

<root> While the Museum of Flight was in the top running , I m disappointed that NASA did not choose them . 

<root> In 2008 , Endeavour and Atlantis await a journey on their respective launchpads . 

<root> Image : NASA . 

<root> " However , the full fuselage trainer , that every astronaut including [ former Museum of Flight CEO ] Bonnie Dunbar has been trained on , will soon call the Museum of Flight home . 

<root> The largest of the trainers , this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts get . 

<root> Visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum . 

<root> It will help inspire young people to the adventure of space and to the excitement of a career in science , technology , engineering and math . " 

<root> Today 's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center , the greater Houston community and the State of Texas , and I m deeply disappointed with the Administration 's misguided decision . 

<root> John Cornyn , U.S. Senator ( R-Texas ) 

<root> Other items include various shuttle simulators which will be given to the Adler Planetarium in Chicago , Illinois , the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum of McMinnville , Oregon , and Texas A&M 's Aerospace Engineering Department . 

<root> The nose cap assembly and crew compartment trainer for the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and orbital maneuvering system engines for the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville , Alabama , the National Air and Space Museum , and the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum . 

<root> NASA is also offering shuttle heat shield tiles to schools and universities that want to share technology and a piece of space history with their students . 

<root> The 30th anniversary of the first shuttle mission coincided with the 50th anniversary of the first manned space flight when Yuri Gagarin lifted off aboard Vostok 1 into space . 

<root> Sensitive Canadian document found on rainy streets 

<root> Friday , August 15 , 2008 

<root> A sensitive Environment Canada document was found wet on an Ottawa street by someone who gave it to the CBC today . 

<root> The 131-page document was found on Castlefrank Road in Kanata , Ontario in a rain-stained , tire-marked brown envelope by a passerby . 

<root> The document which had the stamp Protected B on every page detailed various security vulnerabilities of the NEMISIS database which is used by officers to track and prosecute environmental law-breakers . 

<root> If someone were able to shut the system down , or hack inside and delete or corrupt the information , it could affect the prosecution of the lawbreakers . 

<root> The database was unveiled in 1999 as the National Enforcement Management Information System and Intelligence System . 

<root> However , on the document , it referred to the database as National Enforcement and Emergency Management Information System and Intelligence System , adding the words " and Emergency " to the name . 

<root> Protection B documents are the second lowest grade of classified government documents . 

<root> Environment Canada spokesperson Julie Hahn said they apply to letters of complaint , criticism or injury , research or scientific notes and findings that do n`t have any conclusion , and Treasury Board letters , agendas and minutes that do n`t deal with subjects of national interest . 

<root> Environment Minister John Baird has asked government officials how such documents that are supposed to be stored in " approved security cabinets " wound up on the street . 

<root> " I 'm told two things : that it 's neither classified nor secret and that it 's stuff that could be available under access to information , " Baird said . 

<root> Environment Canada spokeswoman Sujata Raisinghani told CBC News the department will look into the incident . 

<root> " We take document security seriously , " she said , but refused to give any more details about how the papers came to be on a road . 

<root> Paul Dewar , an Ottawa New Democrat MP , said the combined security lapses raise serious questions about the government 's ability to secure sensitive documents . 

<root> Dewar says that bureaucrats of the Conservative government have complained to him about document security to the point that they ca n`t share the information with their own colleagues . 

<root> However , when a government document has been found on the streets , the government then says it was n't particularly sensitive . 

<root> " This government is so consumed with control of information and secrecy yet they do n't seem to be able to get the fundamentals right , " Dewar said . 

<root> The incident is a reminiscent of two other incidents . 

<root> In March , a bundle of blueprints for a new headquarters for the military 's counterterrorism unit were found stuffed in the trash on a downtown street . 

<root> In May , Maxime Bernier was forced to resign as Foreign Affairs minister after it became known that he left sensitive documents at the apartment of his then-girlfriend Julie Couillard who had ties to the Hells Angels biker gang .

<root> Some of the distinctive skyline of Downtown , including the Kaiser Building and the Cathedral of Christ the Light . 

<root> Often overshadowed by San Francisco , its larger neighbor lying directly to the west , Oakland has in recent years began to step out from under the shadows , playing upon the beautiful highlights of its own and its rise as the multicultural " hipster ' city of the Bay Area . 

<root> Since the 1960s , Oakland has been a hub of radical culture , and is the birthplace of both the Black Panther Party and the Hell 's Angels . 

<root> Oakland 's history in the arts and entertainment arena is notable as well , as Oakland has nurtured or been a second home to novelists Gertrude Stein , Jack London , Amy Tan , and Maya Angelou ; actors Meryl Streep , Mark Hamill , Bruce Lee , and Tom Hanks ; architect Julia " Butterfly " Hill ; classical conductor Calvin Simmons ; rappers MC Hammer , 2Pac , Messy Marv , and several other notables in the liberal arts and sciences . 

<root> Oakland as a city reflects the amazing diversity of its residents and long history . 

<root> For many visitors , the first place they are likely to visit is Downtown , especially if they are in town on business , or simply do not know where to start . 

<root> The center of transportation by BART and by bus is there , if one wants to branch out . 

<root> And it is as simple as walking in a direction from there , for the first few neighborhoods , since Old Oakland is along 10th Street , just west of Broadway . 

<root> Just east of Broadway and continuing north and south is Oakland 's famous Chinatown , and that to get the real essence of " Chinatown , " Oakland rather than San Francisco is your best bet . 

<root> Many of the buildings and streets of Chinatown reflect the diverse nature of its history , in architecture and in the bilingual signs seen throughout the neighborhood . 

<root> The curious traveler can venture to take a bus southwards along Broadway , and come to Jack London Square . 

<root> The unlikely mixture of warehouses and very expensive restaurants and posh atmosphere alongside some of the landmarks of the city 's waterfront makes the Square an interesting place to visit and explore , even for locals . 

<root> It 's the home of the USS Potomac and the site of the namesake author 's residence , still preserved and humbly standing not far from a saloon from the same era . 

<root> Just west of Downtown and slightly north of the Financial District is Uptown . 

<root> In the evening it buzzes with art galleries , theaters and residents and Bay Area visitors coming into the area to see concerts . 

<root> A popular area on the weekend with a mixed vibe of hipster and hip hop . 

<root> It 's a burgeoning neighborhood of performing arts ranging from nightclubs to music halls , avant-garde performance art , and even an improv theater company . 

<root> Uptown also has some of the best in the city 's vintage architecture , like the Gothic Revival Cathedral Building and the Art Deco Fox and Paramount Theaters , as well as several restaurants . 

<root> North Oakland is a sweeping term , referring to just about everywhere north of Uptown and Lake Merritt . 

<root> Many of the neighborhoods are commercial centers and absolute heaven for foodies or those who seek quieter surroundings than the hustle and bustle of Downtown and Chinatown . 

<root> Temescal is a neighborhood that lies north-northwest from Downtown , centered along the reach of Telegraph Avenue , at and near 51st Street . 

<root> Until the 1960s , a dominantly Italian-American neighborhood , it is now a much more diversified neighborhood , home to many restaurants , including some of the city 's best Korean and Ethiopian establishments . 

<root> Northeast of Temescal and near the Berkeley border lies Rockridge , a neighborhood mixed with family friendly and artistic vibes . 

<root> It has lots of local boutiques and a diverse range of food at all prices and styles . 

<root> Open-air markets , bookstores , and a BART station all its own make Rockridge another of many pleasant stops in North Oakland . 

<root> South of Rockridge , and southeast of Temescal lies Piedmont Avenue , a street extending from Broadway near 34th and Hawthorne and an area with a group of hospitals on a hill ( Pill Hill ) up and through a neighborhood bordered on both sides by picturesque hills , houses and trees . 

<root> Another of North Oakland 's group of foodie spots , home to the city 's single Michelin-rated restaurant and many others ; cafes , ice cream , coffee shops and pleasant walks complete the vision of this interesting and quiet neighborhood . 

<root> East along I-580 and not far from Piedmont Avenue are two neighborhoods separated by a couple of blocks . 

<root> Grand Lake and Lakeshore both share a friendly , suburban sort of feel . 

<root> The Grand Lake Theater stands at the entrance to the neighborhood that bears its name , a matter of a few hundred feet from Lakeshore Avenue – both are diverse neighborhoods no matter what your budget , be it burgers or sandwiches or a full romantic evening , either of these twin-sister neighborhoods will make a pleasant time , by day or night . 

<root> West Oakland was once a burgeoning working-class neighborhood with its roots tracing as far back as the opening decades of the 19th century . 

<root> It has seen a period of decline between the 1960s and the more recent past . 

<root> Strangely , twice in its history the neighborhood has seen benefits from major earthquakes . 

<root> After the 1906 earthquake , many San Franciscans relocated there , and the industrial development of the 20s and 30s saw its population in the hundreds of thousands . 

<root> With Loma Prieta in 1989 , the effective barrier of the Cypress Street Overpass was destroyed , and the decades since have seen the rebuilding and refurbishing of many of the neighborhood 's original Victorian houses , and there is a burgeoning performing arts community growing near the center of the neighborhood . 

<root> Though there are a few draws for the traveler , West Oakland is dominantly a very poor working-class residential neighborhood with a less than spectacular reputation . 

<root> Respect 

<root> Thais are a polite people and , while remarkably tolerant of foreigners gallivanting on their beaches and with their women , you ll find that you will get more respect if you in turn treat them and their customs with respect . 

<root> The wai 

<root> Ronald McDonald showing how it 's done 

<root> The traditional greeting known as the wai , where you press your hands together as is in prayer and bow slightly , is derived from the Hindu cultural influence from India , and still widely practised . 

<root> Among Thais , there are strict rules of hierarchy that dictate how and when the wai should be given . 

<root> In brief , inferiors salute superiors first . 

<root> You should not wai service people or street vendors . 

<root> The higher your hands go , the more respectful you are . 

<root> You will also often see Thais doing a wai as they walk past temples and spirit houses . 

<root> As a foreign visitor , you are not expected to know how to wai , nor to reciprocate when wai'd to ; 

<root> while you 're unlikely to cause offense if you do , you may well look slightly strange . 

<root> If somebody makes a wai to you , a slight bow alone is more than sufficient for ordinary occasions , and for business , most Thais will shake hands with foreigners instead of waiing anyway . 

<root> Dress 

<root> Personal appearance is very important in Thailand as a measure of respect to other people . 

<root> You will find that dressing appropriately means that you are shown more respect in return . 

<root> This translates in many ways , even sometimes lowering initial offering prices at markets . 

<root> While some allowance is made for the differing customs of foreigners , Thais respond more positively to well-dressed Westerners . 

<root> Traditionally , Thais are modest and conservative dressers . 

<root> At a minimum your clothes should be neat , clean , and free from holes or tears . 

<root> Except at the beach or at sacred sites normal western dress is acceptable for both men and women , except that you should avoid clothing showing a lot of skin . 

<root> Pants are preferable to shorts , blouses should have capped sleeves , and if tank tops are worn , the straps should be thick ( i.e. , not spaghetti straps ) . 

<root> Thai men generally wear pants , and most Thais view an adult man wearing shorts as fairly ridiculous ; 

<root> shorts are primarily worn by laborers and schoolchildren . 

<root> Men 's shorts should be knee length or more , if worn at all . 

<root> Taking off one 's shoes at temples and private homes is mandatory etiquette , and this may even be requested at some shops . 

<root> Wear shoes that slip on and off easily . 

<root> Flip-flops , hiking sandals , and clog-type shoes are usually a good pragmatic choice for traveling in Thailand ; 

<root> only in the most top-end establishments are shoes required . 

<root> It is best to play it safe with wats and other sacred sites in Thailand ; 

<root> your dress should be unambiguously modest and cover your entire torso and most of your limbs . 

<root> For men , ankle-length pants are mandatory ; 

<root> on top , t-shirts are acceptable , though a button-front or polo shirt would be best . 

<root> Many recommend that women wear only full length dresses and skirts ; 

<root> you should make sure that your clothing covers at least your shoulders and your knees and some places may require that you wear ankle-length pants or skirts and long sleeved tops . 

<root> Shorts and sleeveless shirts are highly inappropriate , as are short skirts . 

<root> The rules are even more strict for foreign visitors , so even if you see a local in shorts it 's not OK for everyone . 

<root> Topless sunbathing is common by Western women at many tourist beaches . 

<root> At beaches which are primarily Thai visitors however , this is not advised . 

<root> Religion 

<root> Buddhist prayer flags , Wat Arun , Bangkok 

<root> Monks are an integral part of Buddhism in Thailand , and Thai men are generally expected to spend a certain amount of time living as a monk at least once in their lifetime . 

<root> Buddhist monks are meant to avoid sexual temptations , and in particular they do not touch women or take things from women 's hands . 

<root> Women should make every effort to make way for monks on the street and give them room so they do not have to make contact with you . 

<root> Women should avoid offering anything to a monk with their hands . 

<root> Objects or donations should be placed in front of a monk so he can pick it up , or place it on a special cloth he carries with him . 

<root> Monks will sometimes be aided by a layman who will accept things from women merit-makers on their behalf . 

<root> Theravada Buddhist monks are also supposed to avoid material temptations and as such , are not allowed to touch money , so offering money to a monk is considered to be a sign of disrespect in most Theravada Buddhist cultures . 

<root> Therefore , should you wish to donate to a monk , you should only offer food , and put your monetary donation in the appropriate donation box at the temple . 

<root> Those monks that accept money are almost always fakes . 

<root> Vava’u is a group of more than 50 islands in Tonga , about 150 miles north of Tongatapu . 

<root> They are either raised coral limestone or coral atolls . 

<root> The beautiful harbour opposite the main town of Neiafu ( known as the Port of Refuge Harbour ) is a common destination for yachties sailing the South Pacific . 

<root> The waters of the islands are known for their clarity , it being said that you can see the bottom at 40 metres . 

<root> The area attracts many humpback whales between June and November and there are lots of companies organising tours to see them . 

<root> There are numerous places to stay to suit most budgets . 

<root> Understand 

<root> Findings of Lapita pottery suggest that early-Polynesians were on these islands close to 3000 years ago . 

<root> These days there are around 20000 people living in the Group . 

<root> Neiafu and surrounding villages are home to about a third of the Group ’s overall population of around 20000 , with the majority of the population living in small villages on the other islands . 

<root> Neiafu is the official port of entry for yachts coming to Vava'u , which attracts over 500 yachts every winter sailing season between June and October . 

<root> A string of islands and reefs along the eastern edge of the Group shelters the area from strong winds and ocean swellS and humpback whales come to these protected waters to give birth . 

<root> This is the high season for tourism ; 

<root> between December and April few people visit and many tour companies and restaurants close down . 

<root> Neiafu town is the centre of activity . 

<root> It is on the southern point of the main island of Utu Vava'u and has an attractive setting on one of the world 's most beautiful harbours . 

<root> Neiafu offers all the usual amenities including banks , schools , tour companies , restaurants , cafes and bars , supermarkets , a market and a hospital . 

<root> It does n't have a beach but boats to one of the nearby coral atolls with superb sandy beaches are easily available . 

<root> Climate 

<root> Vava'u has a tropical climate with average temperatures up to 29 ºC in January and down to 24 ºC in June . 

<root> It is sunny throughout the year . 

<root> Between November and April , it is more humid and thunderstorms and cyclones do occur . 

<root> From May to September there are southeast trade winds but during the summer months the winds are from the northeast . 

<root> Port of Refuge Harbor at Neiafu 

<root> Orientation 

<root> The main islands are : Utu Vava'u . 

<root> This is the largest island , where Neiafu is found . 

<root> It is a limestone island with heights up to 213 m in the west . 

<root> The island provides a home to eleven indigenous bird species and contains Mt. Talau national park , with some of the limited remaining native vegetation . 

<root> Tropical vegetation includes the pandanus or screw pine , the casuarina , and the mulberry tree , the bark of which is used to make tapa cloth . 

<root> Pangaimotu . 

<root> This is the second largest island in the Group . 

<root> It can be seen across the water from Neiafu and is connected by land bridge at the most southern point of ‘Utu Vava’u . 

<root> There are some good beaches and plenty of secluded cove beaches and protected bays with good snorkelling . 

<root> Avai'o'vuna Swamp is a small coastal wetland on the island . 

<root> Hunga Island . 

<root> This is some 35 minutes from Neiafu Harbour and provides the main concentration of humpback whales . 

<root> The island lies in deep water and has sheltered waters and bays which provide a resting place for humpbacks with calves . 

<root> How to Grow Beavertail Cactus 

<root> The Beavertail Cactus ( Opunitia basilares ) , found primarily in the Mojave Desert and northwest Mexico ; can grow to be about 24 inches ( 60 cm ) high ; has pads that look like beavertails ; and yields red or purple flowers from spring to early summer . 

<root> Growing Beavertail can be done at any time of year by scattering seeds in a shady bed or , for faster results , planting cuttings in a mix of soil and sand and ensuring that they have a bit of water and plenty of sun . 

<root> Read the following steps to find out how to grow Beavertail cactus . 

<root> Method 1 of 2 : From Seeds 

<root> Purchase Beavertail cactus seeds . 

<root> These can be bought at garden centers or purchased online . 

<root> Scatter the seeds . 

<root> In a shady garden bed , simply scatter the seeds on the soil . 

<root> There 's no need to cover them , unless you want to use netting to keep the birds off . 

<root> Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate . 

<root> Make sure that the garden bed is in the shade . 

<root> Beavertail cacti seeds need shade to grow , whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlight . 

<root> Be aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cutting . 

<root> It can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowers . 

<root> Method 2 of 2 : From Cuttings 

<root> Obtain Beavertail cuttings . 

<root> You can purchase them online or at a local garden center . 

<root> If you already own a Beavertail cactus , you can make your own cuttings . 

<root> To do this , choose pads ( the flat , oval-shaped sections that make up a cactus ) that are 6 months old or older and cut them at the base . 

<root> In order to form a callous and prevent rot , cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry , dark place for 10 to 14 days . 

<root> Plant the cuttings . 

<root> Prepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with it . 

<root> Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage . 

<root> Set the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch ( 2.5 cm. ) deep . 

<root> If you plant the cuttings too deep , they might rot . 

<root> Put some rocks around the pad to anchor it in place . 

<root> Choose a spot for your Beavertail cactus cuttings . 

<root> If you live in an area with strong summer sun , position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and south . 

<root> This will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day . 

<root> Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds . 

<root> Wait for a month . 

<root> Do not water the cutting for the first month . 

<root> The moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow . 

<root> Too much water might cause rot . 

<root> After 1 month , roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time . 

<root> Always let the soil dry before you water the cuttings . 

<root> Once fully rooted , they are extremely drought resistant . 

<root> Fertilize the plants . 

<root> During the spring , summer , and fall , the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer . 

<root> Let the cuttings grow . 

<root> From the first pad , many more will form . 

<root> The second or third pad will bear some flowers , but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests .

<root> Preheat the oven to 180 oC / 350 oF . 

<root> Prepare the muffin tray by adding cupcake holders / cases . 

<root> Put to one side . 

<root> Alternatively , use a silicone cupcake baking sheet with molded holes . 

<root> Put the cider vinegar into a small bowl and add the soy milk . 

<root> Stir this well and then put to one side . 

<root> The mixture will now curdle and this is what should be happening .

<root> If you prefer larger cupcakes , then add a half a cup but make sure the muffin pan is larger and the cupcake holders are bigger . 

<root> Bake for 18 - 20 minutes . 

<root> If you can smell the cupcakes earlier , check to make sure they are n't browning earlier ( this means they 're more than ready ) . 

<root> If you are n't certain , turn off the oven earlier and let them sit for a few more minutes rather than bake them into rocks . 

<root> Wait for the pan to cool down .

<root> Let cool completely on the rack . 

<root> Frost as desired . 

<root> Add standard frosting or make vegan butter cream . 

<root> Tips 

<root> You can add pureed fruit for delicious flavor changes . 

<root> One small container of pureed fruit is sufficient for flavoring ( the little containers that children take to school in their lunchboxes . ) 

<root> Try strawberry , apple , banana , apricot , peach etc . 

<root> The cupcakes will not be as light and fluffy , however , so be prepared for a heavier cupcake if you add fruit but the added moisture content is a definite plus . 

<root> Instead of using vegan sugar , you can replace it with equal parts maple sugar or rice syrup 

<root> Instead of using vegetable oil , try substituting it for walnut or macadamia nut oils if they are available to you . 

<root> Coconut oil also produces good results . 

<root> And olive oil works fine if it 's all that 's left in the pantry . 

<root> You can replace the plain soy milk with other flavors like chocolate or vanilla if you want to experiment with changing the flavor of the cupcakes . 

<root> Experiment with the flavors of either recipe by replacing the vanilla extract with fragrant ingredients like neroli orange oil , rosewater , orange blossom water or coconut extract . 

<root> How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally 

<root> Having mice in your home is both a nuisance and a health hazard . 

<root> They can cause property damage , create a mess , and produce unpleasant smells . 

<root> In addition , repelling and removing rodents from your home can be a hassle if you do n't know what you are doing . 

<root> It can also be dangerous if you use toxic chemicals and poisons . 

<root> It 's a good thing , then , that there are some simple ways to effectively get mice out of your home without the use of toxic chemicals and poisons . 

<root> Method 1 Discouraging Mice Naturally 

<root> Keep your home clean . 

<root> Many times mice are drawn into homes on the search for food . 

<root> If there is nothing to eat , mice will be less likely to stay . 

<root> Keep all food stored properly in airtight containers or in places that are safe from mouse attack . [ 1 ] 

<root> Apply peppermint oil . 

<root> Peppermint oil is a natural deterrent . 

<root> The smell is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near it . 

<root> It also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaning . 

<root> It also gives the house a lovely smell , and is not toxic , unlike many synthetic chemical treatments . 

<root> You can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores . [ 2 ] 

<root> Place a drop or two on a cotton ball . 

<root> Place a cotton ball under or near your garbage can to deter mice from getting into it . 

<root> Place the cotton balls in areas where mice are likely to enter your house , by doorways , or heat vents , etc . 

<root> Peppermint oil cotton balls need to be replaced after 5 - 7 days , depending upon the quantity of oil you put on it . 

<root> Try growing peppermint plants near the entryways . 

<root> You can use the mint in cooking , as well as it serving a deterrent purpose . 

<root> Use dried snake feces . 

<root> Visit a local reptile center , zoo , or pet store and ask for some dried snake poo . 

<root> You can also sometimes find someone who owns a pet snake . 

<root> Place near entrances and in places where mice seem to go . 

<root> This will keep mice away . [ 3 ] 

<root> Be sure to keep the feces out of the reach of children and pets . 

<root> Zap mice with ultrasonic sounds . 

<root> There are electronic units sold that emit an ultrasonic beeping sound that rodents hate . 

<root> They should be available at your local home improvement store or online . 

<root> These work only on a single line of sight , so you need to know the exact path the mice are taking . 

<root> The units may only work for a short time because mice can become used to them . [ 4 ] 

<root> Use a commercial , organic deterrent . 

<root> Many companies that specialize in organic garden and home products make mice repellents that are better for the environment than traditional poisons . 

<root> Many of these products use natural ingredients , such as peppermint , that are known to be disagreeable to mice . 

<root> They will not kill mice but they should keep them out of areas where the product is applied . 

<root> These products should be available at your local gardening or home improvement center . 

<root> If you want a specific product , try doing a online search to see where it is available locally . 

<root> Get a cat . 

<root> A house cat can take care of the problem . 

<root> Cats that spend time outdoors are more likely to hunt to find their own food and may track down that mouse . 

<root> Just be aware , not all cats have enough energy , interest or training to hunt mice . 

<root> Kittens typically have to be taught by the mother to easily become a mouser . 

<root> Well-food indoor kitties might just see the mouse as a toy , and grow quickly bored of it after scaring it half witless . 

<root> Shelters and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter , and generally do not test for this . 

<root> Sometimes this information is available , but usually not . 

<root> While many mousers are great pets as well , not all are . 

<root> " Barn cats " may not be socialized well with humans , although used to hunting mice for food . 

<root> Even if you do not have a cat , you can use used kitty litter to deter mice . 

<root> Place tubs of used kitty litter around entrances of the house . 

<root> The mice will sniff the smell of cat urine and clear off in a jiffy . 

<root> If you have a large infestation , a cat may not be enough to totally get rid of it . 

<root> However , once you eliminate the infestation , a cat will probably prevent reinfestation . [ 5 ] 

<root> Put your trash cans far from your home . 

<root> Mice smell garbage and get attracted to your house . 

<root> If you keep the cans away from the house , they are less likely to take up residence in your home . 

<root> Promote the nesting of birds of prey in your yard . 

<root> Build a shelter box in your garden to attract some onto your property . 

<root> This may take some time , but it 's worth the effort if you can attract a wild mouse eater to your yard . [ 6 ] 

<root> Make sure the shelter box has no nails or safety hazards . 

<root> A barn owl is the best . 

<root> A family of barn owls can eat many mice in a night ! 

<root> However , you might attract other types of owls or birds of prey with your nesting box .
