<root> What if Google Morphed Into GoogleOS ? 

<root> What if Google expanded on its search - engine ( and now e-mail ) wares into a full - fledged operating system ? 

<root> [ via Microsoft Watch from Mary Jo Foley ] 

<root> ( And , by the way , is anybody else just a little nostalgic for the days when that was a good thing ? ) 

<root> This BuzzMachine post argues that Google 's rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which we 've all heard before , but it 's particularly well - put in this post . 

<root> Google is a nice search engine . 

<root> Does anybody use it for anything else ? 

<root> They own blogger , of course . 

<root> Is that a money maker ? 

<root> I 'm staying away from the stock . 

<root> I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet , but I figured I would put it out there anyways . 

<root> John Donovan from Argghhh! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah . 

<root> Click here To view it . 

<root> He makes some good observations on a few of the pic's . 

<root> One of the pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah . 

<root> On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video's . 

<root> Compare the flags to the Fallujah one . 

<root> You have to see these slides .... they are amazing . 

<root> This Fallujah operation my turn out to be the most important operation done by the US Military since the end of the war . 

<root> Let me join the chorus of annoyance over Google 's new toolbar , which , as noted in the linked article , commits just about every sin an online marketer could commit , and makes up a few new ones besides . 

<root> I 'm not fond of the Google - hates - privacy argument 

<root> ( You do n't need to use their site , you can opt - out of sharing your information , you do n't need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account , and if -- wonder of wonders -- you 're worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account ... you have far , far too much time on your hands ) . 

<root> However , this toolbar is really bad news . 

<root> On the other hand , it looks pretty cool . 

<root> Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons . 

<root> The United States does n't believe the Iranian Government . 

<root> One can suspect the Iranian Government . 

<root> But there is no proof . 

<root> I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article . 

<root> They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti-proliferation treaty . 

<root> The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he could n't even begin to try without nuclear weapons . 

<root> But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes . 

<root> Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure . 

<root> But will diplomacy work ? 

<root> And can anyone use military pressure without proof ? 

<root> One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage . 

<root> He has denied this . 

<root> We do n't have to believe him . 

<root> But we ca n't prove it . 

<root> It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof . 

<root> Angry crowds chanted anti-American slogans in the western city of Falluja ( pop. 256,000 ) as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by US troops were buried on Saturday . 

<root> Reuters reported that " Sunni clerics in the town issued a ' Declaration by the people of Fallujah ' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police , announcing three days of mourning , and calling for a general strike today . " 

<root> It read , " The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah . 

<root> Let aggressive ( American ) leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city 's security and safety , and ask them to lift their hands from the city . " 

<root> The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders . 

<root> Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the US soldiers there , since local Sunnis either remain committed to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalists or even radicals . 

<root> Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country 's wealth and power . 

<root> They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion , and an elevation of the Shiites and Kurds , and they refuse to go quietly .

<root> The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D.C. Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long . 

<root> The actual vote is a little confusing . 

<root> Stay with me now : John Paul STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV , VI through VI - D - iii , VI - D - v , and VII , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined , and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI - D - iv , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined . 

<root> BREYER filed a concurring opinion , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , and GINSBURG joined . 

<root> KENNEDY filed an opinion concurring in part , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined as to Parts I and II . 

<root> SCALIA filed a dissenting opinion , in which THOMAS and ALITO joined . 

<root> THOMAS filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA joined , and in which ALITO joined as to all but Parts I , II - C - 1 , and III - B - 2 . 

<root> ALITO filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA and THOMAS joined as to Parts I through III . 

<root> It will take me a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion . 

<root> I 'll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I 'm finished . 

<root> Important news such as President Bush 's miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti-gay ( update : he 's not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely . 

<root> I had to go to the BBC for this report . 

<root> It 's symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers . 

<root> It 's just disappointing . 

<root> Most troubling , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed . 

<root> At that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours . 

<root> Two weeks later , and the violence continues . 

<root> The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace , pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15,000 , according to analysts . 

<root> And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs , according to the local UN officials . 

<root> So hear we are , two weeks later , after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged . 

<root> Warren Buffett is giving away 85 % of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . 

<root> It 's a move that really worries me ; Buffett 's usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later . 

<root> It 's a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible . 

<root> Which essentially sounds like he 's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon . 

<root> I assume his actual reason is that he 's worried that Berkshire Hathaway just ca n't grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy . 

<root> I 'm not sure how the market will react . 

<root> It does n't change the company 's intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid . 

<root> On the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century . 

<root> em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education , that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years . 

<root> Because the 10.000.000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead . 

<root> i.e . 

<root> He 's not giving 85 % away , he 's giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ? ) . 

<root> He mentions his wife 's death having an effect on him . 

<root> It sounds pretty rational that he 's saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound . 

<root> Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party : 

<root> On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections . 

<root> To the north in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria 's promised withdrawal . 

<root> Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun . 

<root> UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to " recognize Hezbollah " after easily being duped by " the message on the placards they are using " . 

<root> This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media . 

<root> Over three years after 9-11 , the United Nations , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still can not properly define the word " terrorist " , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts . 

<root> The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates . 

<root> ... 

<root> The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media . 

<root> I 've been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now , ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon . 

<root> Wtf is this ? 

<root> This is a terrorist organization plain and simple . 

<root> This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80's and now they should be considered a legitimate organization ? 

<root> This is just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the Europeans . 

<root> The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the Americans . 

<root> It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government . 

<root> The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars . 

<root> That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing , thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government . 

<root> Az - Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans . 

<root> In a communique , the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with " raiding forces " in the assault on a city , the population of which is Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins . 

<root> The Sunni AMS told Iraqis , " You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah . 

<root> Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral . " 

<root> The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well . 

<root> The statement said , " We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal . " 

<root> It called a " ploy " the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah . 

<root> The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before , last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf . 

<root> Most Shiites , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti-Shiite pogroms . 

<root> President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words : 

<root> WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - 

<root> U.S. Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a " war with Islamic fascists , " saying the term could inflame anti-Muslim tensions . 

<root> U.S. officials have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda . 

<root> " We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism , " said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group . 

<root> Which is why he did n't say we 're at war with Islamic people . 

<root> We 're at war with Islamic fascists . 

<root> By using the word " Islamic " as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism , hence the qualifier . 

<root> And if you have n't heard by now , the roster of suspected terrorists has not a Tom , Dick or Harry among them :

<root> Zakaria Amara , 20 , Mississauga , Ont. ; 

<root> Asad Ansari , 21 , Mississauga ; 

<root> Shareef Abdelhaleen , 30 , Mississauga ;

<root> Amin Mohamed Durrani , 19 , Toronto ; 

<root> Steven Vikash Chand alias Abdul Shakur , 25 , Toronto ; 

<root> Ahmad Mustafa Ghany , 21 , Mississauga ; 

<root> Saad Khalid , 19 , of Eclipse Avenue , Mississauga . 

<root> We 've got a Steven , the one word that did n't crash my spell - check , despite it being followed by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur . 

<root> Folks , if it 's Islamic , and fascist , it 's an Islamic fascist . 

<root> But because we do n't want to sound hateful we must pretend everyone 's a possible suspect and make airline travel more miserable than it 's ever been . 

<root> On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , " We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden . " 

<root> This pledge is a new development . 

<root> Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al - Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days . 

<root> One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century . 

<root> If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being " picked up " by al - Qaeda . 

<root> This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush 's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath . 

<root> It is a setback for the war on terror . 

<root> Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred " Afghan Arabs " who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden . 

<root> It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5,000 - strong " 55th Brigade " of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition . 

<root> Because Usamah is Saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia 's some 15 million citizens . 

<root> In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of these were from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ) . 

<root> After that point , al - Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were Saudi . 

<root> Zarqawi is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian . 

<root> They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany . 

<root> They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought , which has a Protestant - like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad . 

<root> ( Most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ) . 

<root> Monotheism and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism , rather as the the leaders of the so - called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did . 

<root> Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia . 

<root> These have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra . 

<root> So now there are hundreds of al - Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before . 

<root> The consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with al - Qaeda can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in Tangiers that morphed into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta , and ultimately was in part responsible for the Madrid train bombings . 

<root> The September 11 Panel will issue its findings on Thursday . 

<root> It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden 's plot . 

<root> Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush . 

<root> Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton . 

<root> This statement is , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel words . 

<root> Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming . 

<root> The question is , " Should he have known it was coming ? " 

<root> The answer is , " Yes ! " 

<root> We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq . 

<root> Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there , already in January or February of 2001 . 

<root> Wolfowitz contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie 's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing . 

<root> If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat . 

<root> Even after the attacks on September 11 , Bush was obsessing about Iraq . 

<root> Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them . 

<root> ( On what evidence ? 

<root> The hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ) . 

<root> Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were " no good targets " in Afghanistan . 

<root> ( What about 40 al - Qaeda bases that had trained the 9/11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States ?? ) 

<root> The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward . 

<root> Bush did not have his eye on the ball . 

<root> Neither did Cheney , Rumsfeld , or Wolfowitz . 

<root> They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam 's great white whale . 

<root> Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed . 

<root> They were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to . 

<root> Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet . 

<root> Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet 's hair was " on fire " about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists . 

<root> As for the Clinton administration , let me say one thing in its defense . 

<root> Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan . 

<root> I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong . 

<root> You also need Pakistani air space . 

<root> The plan was all set and could have succeeded . 

<root> But in fall of 1999 , Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif . 

<root> The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal . 

<root> Musharraf told Clinton he could n't use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden . 

<root> Look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities . 

<root> Of course , you could just go in by main force . 

<root> But for those of you tempted in that direction , please look up Carter 's Tabas operation . 

<root> It should be easily googled . 

<root> Clinton tried , and tried hard . 

<root> The gods were n't with us on that one . 

<root> that is how i want you to refer to me as " the king " 

<root> i do n't think so . 

<root> i 'm the king 

<root> yeah 

<root> sounds exciting . 

<root> want to go to dinner with me before you have your ' matt time ' ?

<root> John , 

<root> Hello from South America . 

<root> I just got your email and I certainly concur with Jeff making the call . 

<root> He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva . 

<root> This was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding performance . 

<root> I do n't know how much it will help however . 

<root> Richard Harper and Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you 've already gone through it with them . 

<root> I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old project . 

<root> When you discussed it , i was trying to think back to our remedies and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult . 

<root> I do n't know if there is anything I can do but I 'm always willing to help . 

<root> Good luck ,

<root> not sure , but i assume that the bluegrass songbook is mine . 

<root> is it for guitar ? 

<root> I 'll need to ponder . 

<root> I 'll try to get back to you pronto . 

<root> FYI . 

<root> We have this report ? 

<root> Hi David : 

<root> Thought that you might be interested . 

<root> Best , 

<root> Jeff 

<root> Well , he launched today . 

<root> Have you seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today ? 

<root> I think this is actually a good thing -- makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison , makes our support in the process more important , and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California 's broken system --- a potential spoiler . 

<root> Hi . 

<root> Well , would n't you know it . 

<root> I 'm not driving tonite , but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil . 

<root> I 'm not sure , but I think that he 's got class tonite , too . 

<root> I 'll search him out before class or after that break and see if I can set it up . 

<root> daily dose on enron - 

<root> we are finished . 

<root> i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills . 

<root> the economy is down and when enron collapses , the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt . 

<root> not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks . 

<root> ca n't go to any more lsu games unless i get a free ticket . 

<root> Since work has gone to hell , I am hoping to find some excitement in the possibility that LSU may play in the Cotton Bowl ( if Rohan " Alabama " Davey shows up for the next 3 games . ) 

<root> However , do not purchase tickets until it is a done deal - a lesson I learned following the Ark game last season .

<root> i have stronger will than you think . 

<root> house of pies here i come . 

<root> i am sure i could have persuaded you to give me some action . 

<root> why is enron blowing up ? 

<root> i did n't want you to go . 

<root> i was just going to sleep anyway . 

<root> i was too tired to give you any action . 

<root> enron is blowing up . 

<root> Vince , 

<root> We are still trying to work the PSE swap transaction , now that the forex desk has been able to find a fix for CPI in the market . 

<root> Further to my voicemail , our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve on the PSE swap . 

<root> They are currently using 9.5 % fixed based on the 1 year implied volatility . 

<root> Volatility of USD / DM has been in the range of between 7 % and 11 % . 

<root> Can one of your research staff justify a suitable 20 year volalatility number for USD / Euro . 

<root> Ideally , we would like a fast turnaround . 

<root> In addition , is there someone who could consider the correlation between US CPI and the $ / euro exchange rate . 

<root> The credit guys are currently assuming that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the credit reserve on this basis too . 

<root> Grateful for any help or suggestions you could provide . 

<root> Sid 

<root> Vincent , 

<root> I met you at the Risk conference last week in Houston . 

<root> I enjoyed your presentations very much . 

<root> I was wondering if you could give me some references regarding the calculation of correlation coefficients from a GARCH model . 

<root> Thank you .

<root> I have settled the Ecogas / Enron / Randy Maffett lawsuit . 

<root> No need to thank me , just send me gifts . 

<root> Seriously , I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we agreed that Ecogas would pay him $ 53,000 . 

<root> Hall has agreed to release Enron , Ecogas , Maffett and every affiliate , related party and subsidiary . 

<root> He will also release any and all patent issues . 

<root> The goal is for him to move on with his life and for us to move on as well .

<root> But let me know if I can spend a day , morning , or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good time .

<root> it is to late for me to add changes . 

<root> We will have to correct them after the churn . 

<root> Thank you for you patience . 

<root> The Dow topped out in February of 1966 at 995 . 

<root> By September of that year the Dow had tumbled to 744 . 

<root> The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67 . 

<root> By March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825 , only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in December of '68 . 

<root> The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70 . 

<root> By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950 , only to fall to 869 in February of '72 . 

<root> A big rally then took the Dow ( unconfirmed ) to a record high of 1051 in January of '73 , turning everyone bullish . 

<root> But by December of '73 the Dow had collapsed to 788 . 

<root> Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577 . 

<root> At that time , the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of capitalism . 

<root> Of course , that was the bottom 

<root> And that 's the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down . 

<root> By late 1974 investors were dizzy , they were desperate , they were wrung - out , they had left Wall Street , many for good . 

<root> great , we look forward to seeing you .

<root> FYI , 

<root> Per the memo , ENA 's storage account will be REDUCED by 420,588 mmbtu !!!!!! 

<root> Robert D Morgan 

<root> 09/08/2000 09:36 AM 

<root> The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been discussed with each of you over the last three months . 

<root> As we have discussed .... effective Sep 13th , Anita will make the adjustments to Enron 's inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results . 

<root> I talked with Gary Wilson , and he confirmed that the revised values are correct . 

<root> Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values . 

<root> The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections . 

<root> The results of the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487 MMBTU . 

<root> In addition , there is a reduction of 22,101 MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA values ( Best Available ) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet and the " official " February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS . 

<root> To summarize : Enron 's pad gas will now be 3,993,310 MMBTU , instead of 4,223,000 MMBTU . 

<root> Enron 's working gas will be reduced by 420,588 MMBTU . 

<root> Call me if there are any questions . 

<root> fyi 

<root> yeah i got yelled at also . 

<root> i tried to say i was n't that drunk but z was n't having any of that conversation . 

<root> she told me that after friday and saturday she felt i was slowly regressing . 

<root> then i told her i felt i should be able to screw missy just once . 

<root> she said that was ok . 

<root> Did you get in as much trouble as I did this weekend - Lori seems to think I need to get help - I told her it 's normal to drink all day at a bar , then go to dinner where you do n't know half the people there and proceed to get extremely fucked up

<root> Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made in support of EPMI 's obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement ( " PPA " ) and Green Premium Sharing Agreement ( " GSPA " ) .? 

<root> The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our Cabazon Wind Power Project ( the project most recently financed by EWC ) and the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty . 

<root> As we discussed last week , since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants , we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by Enron and the banks . 

<root> We plan to use the same basic form for the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the seller 's obligations under the PPA . 

<root> We will forward the draft of that guaranty to you later today . 

<root> Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions concerning the attached guaranties .

<root> Al , 

<root> I have spoken with Mark Lay and he is interested . 

<root> Even if we can not help you here in Enron , he may be able to put you in touch with other CV groups in town . 

<root> Please , call him directly and give my name as a reference . 

<root> ( 713 ) 853-7408

<root> Al , 

<root> I have called Mark Lay and left a message on his voice mail . 

<root> Vince 

<root> Al Arfsten < arfsten@bflassociates.com > on 01/24/2001 11:16:25 AM 

<root> Vince : 

<root> Your suggestion to introduce the concept discussed with one of the Lays is welcomed . 

<root> I hope that this would mean that you would remain involved at some level . 

<root> The design of the model and its potential economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be . 

<root> Enron could be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to commercialization could be successfully accomplished . 

<root> Please confidentially share matters as you think best and advise me of the interest generated . 

<root> I am ready to meet there at your building or elsewhere that is appropriate . 

<root> Best regards , 

<root> Al Arfsten 713 965 2158

<root> No problem .

<root> Key Delhi blast suspect arrested 

<root> Police in the Indian capital Delhi say they have arrested the suspected co-ordinator and financier of last month 's deadly bomb blasts in the city . 

<root> Delhi police chief K K Paul named the man as Tariq Ahmed Dar , and said police were hunting for four accomplices . 

<root> He said Mr Dar , 33 , was arrested in Indian - administered Kashmir and belonged to the outlawed Lashkar - e - Toiba militant group .

<root> Alteration of the Mississippi River and the destruction of wetlands at its mouth have left the area around New Orleans abnormally vulnerable to the forces of nature .

<root> Wei 's Magic Cubes 

<root> Wei Ligang , a rising star of modern art in China , just had an exhibition in mid-July , 2005 in Hong Kong . 

<root> He is now lecturing in USA . 

<root> His art perfectly combines painting and Chinese calligraphy . 

<root> He is regarded as one of the leading Avant - Garde artist of modern calligraphy . 

<root> His artworks were selected and exhibited in British Museum in 2002 . 

<root> " Wei has given some virtuoso performances with brush and ink , often incorporating several different techniques into a single work , " said Gordon S. Barrass , curator of the exhibition . 

<root> In the world of " Wei 's magic cubes , " all seem to be ingeniously planned and tricky . 

<root> All are mathematical , all are linguistic . 

<root> In Wei 's art , a logician could see mathematical logic , a cellist could see a ripple of nine bass notes , a country girl could see straw , and Harry Potter could see two accompanied green blazes . 

<root> " ... to gaze at Wei 's art is like entering a floating world of dreams . "

<root> Wiki Media Foundation , the group behind the Wikipedia online encyclopedia project , said Friday that search giant Google has volunteered to host some of its content on company servers . 

<root> ( ZD Net ) 

<root> It looks like the war between Microsoft and Google is quickly brewing on the horizon . 

<root> Microsoft is 4 - 0 ( they took down Netscape , Suns Systems , MAC and IBM ) and Google may be their next target . 

<root> Google is probably making this move to counter Microsoft Search using Encarta ( it's online dictionary ) . 

<root> More below . 

<root> But it looks like Google is n't opening it's mouth about the reason behind the offer as Linux News reports : 

<root> " While we do n't have anything specific to announce today , Google and the Wikimedia Foundation are collaboratively evaluating creative ways to support Wikipedia.org and its community . " 

<root> Sure Google , although this would put it on coarse for global domination of the internet by 2014 . 

<root> It will be interesting to see whether or not Google will finally slay the Microsoft Goliath , who has known no major defeat and seeks to vanquish all competition .

<root> Hello there 

<root> Action Network is a BBC website for people who are taking action on issues that concern them . 

<root> I 'm getting in touch because I think it could be useful to people campaigning about hospital closures . 

<root> We 've got a page dedicated to issues around hospitals ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153 ) and a group called NHS SOS have already put up a campaign about ward closures in Cumbria . 

<root> I 'm hoping to build this up to be a hub for all the campaigners - a place where people can exchange ideas and advice . 

<root> It would be great if the person from CHANT who started this page would put up a short description of the campaign and a list to this group page on the Action Network site . 

<root> Action Network is also a good place to post details of events , or try to rally together a group if you want to take action in your area . 

<root> You can attach anything you write to pages for your local area , as well as to the ' issue ' pages . 

<root> I 'm more than happy to help people with the site or answer any questions about Action Network - just drop me a message . 

<root> Otherwise , hope to see you there !

<root> Winston Peters is visiting a school . 

<root> In one class , he asks the students if anyone can give him an example of a " tragedy " . 

<root> One little boy stands up and offers that , " if my best friend who lives next door was playing in the street when a car came along and killed him , that would be a tragedy " . 

<root> " No , " Winston says , " That would be an ACCIDENT . " 

<root> A girl raises her hand . 

<root> " If a school bus carrying fifty children drove off a cliff , killing everyone involved ... that would be a tragedy " . 

<root> " I 'm afraid not , " explains Winston , " that is what we would call a GREAT LOSS . " 

<root> The room is silent , none of the other children volunteer . 

<root> " What ? " asks Winston , " is n't there any one here who can give me an example of a tragedy ? " 

<root> Finally , a boy in the back raises his hand . 

<root> In a timid voice , he says : " If an airplane carrying Winston Peters was blown up by a bomb , THAT would be a tragedy " . 

<root> " Wonderful ! " Winston beams . 

<root> " Marvelous ! 

<root> And can you tell me WHY that would be a tragedy ? " 

<root> " Well , " says the boy , " because it would n't be an accident , and it certainly would n't be a great loss ! "

<root> It looks like The Lunar Transportation Systems , Inc. is visualizing a " space highway " going from the moon to Earth ( and back again ) . 

<root> " Our new lunar transportation system utilizes a unique architecture that will establish the equivalent of a two - way highway between the Earth and the Moon , " Kistler told SPACE.com . 

<root> " Our plans include raising private capital to develop , build , flight test , and operate this Earth - Moon highway for the benefit of the country and the benefit of our investors . " 

<root> Wise decision to go through the private sector -- NASA 's budget may be kinda tight to fund a project like this . 

<root> This group does sound pretty interesting though . 

<root> The Lunar Transporatation Systems ( LTS ) is actually being funded by two space businessmen , Walter Kistler and Bob Citron . 

<root> Both of these men are heavily involved in the private sector of the space industry , and both are also involved with another space company called SPACEHAB . 

<root> They want to use LTS to tie into NASA 's vision for Space Exploration , and seem pleased that the White House is moving in that direction . 

<root> " We are so excited that the White House and the recent new government space policy underscores the need to involve the private sector in assisting NASA develop its plans for the new Vision for Space Exploration , " said Walter Kistler , LTS co-founder and Chairman . 

<root> With their proposal of a " Earth - Moon " highway , it looks like space tourism may become a reality sooner than we think .

<root> ( Space.com ) 

<root> U.S. astronauts will launch to the moon on sleek , single , shuttle booster rockets and the first new upper - stage rocket this country has developed in more than a decade , NASA and the Pentagon have told the White House . 

<root> Lunar landers and other gear needed for extended visits to the moon will be lofted by gargantuan launchers as big as the Apollo - era Saturn 5 , the most powerful rockets ever flown . 

<root> It looks as if NASA is transitioning away from the shuttle model , as in the past they have proven to be quite dangerous as Columbia has recently proved . 

<root> Although these new rockets are probably more expensive , they will be able to go at a much greater range than it's shuttle cousins , as they can not only break free from the atmosphere but reach the moon as well . 

<root> " NASA will initiate development of a Crew Launch Vehicle derived from space shuttle solid rocket boosters with a new upper stage for human spaceflight , " said the letter , signed by NASA Administrator Mike Griffin and the Pentagon 's top space official , ex-astronaut Ron Sega ... 

<root> " NASA then plans to develop a new 100 - metric - ton - class launch vehicle derived from existing capabilities with the space shuttle external tanks and solid rocket boosters for future missions to the moon , " the letter said . 

<root> NASA is planning on using these new shuttles to replace the current models , with industry forecasters predicting a launch as early as 2014 . 

<root> The new rocket design will differ slightly from it's predecessors , in the fact that the crew and cargo would launch separately from two different rockets each and join up in space later on . 

<root> Launching this way will hopefully avoid future disasters , giving more support towards NASA revisiting the stars .

<root> Backdrop stand . 

<root> Google the term or find photography supplies websites and put it in the search box ( or look for studio equipment supplies ) . 

<root> out of carnival , royal caribbean , and norweigan ( cruises ) which is the best and why ? 

<root> I prefer Royal Caribbean out of all these . 

<root> There is so much to do onboard . 

<root> The new NCL Epic does sound amazing , although I have n't sailed on her yet . 

<root> None of the above . 

<root> Of THESE three , it 's a toss - up between Royal and Carnival . 

<root> NCL is a notch below either , in terms of quality and service . 

<root> Will USB cell phone chargers still charge even if they 're hooked up to a computer that is turned off ? 

<root> Mine does . 

<root> I have the HTC Evo . 

<root> depends on the computer 

<root> if the computer is completely shut off , the USB ports are n't getting power , so they wo n't charge your phone 

<root> many PCs have sleep & charge now , that allow the PC to go into sleep mode , and still allow the USB ports to charge things like phones .

<root> What are some cool ideas for making a postor usint the word MAD on a white paper in a weird or artsy way ?

<root> use photoshop . 

<root> tttthhhhh Madonna ! 

<root> what is the fall of hanoi ?

<root> When the French returned to Indochina at the end of WW II the Viet Minh were in control of the Red River Delta . 

<root> They chased the Communists out of the capital ( Hanoi ) and retook control . 

<root> Is that what you are referring to ? 

<root> You need to check out the French Indochina War ( 1946 - 1954 ) not the Vietnam War ( 1957 - 1975 ) . 

<root> Does a pacman absolutely need a uv lamp ? 

<root> Or maybe something humid or heat ? 

<root> I assume you are talking about a pacman frog . 

<root> No , technically they do not need a UVB light ; they are nocturnal . 

<root> However , it certainly would n't hurt if you wanted to provide one . 

<root> A pacman frog will need a heat source that creates a basking temp in the upper 80's F for at least 10 - 12 hours a day . 

<root> do n't forget to use a calcium supplement twice a week ; captive reptiles are prone to calcium deficiency .

<root> how many ounces in a pint in ireland ? 

<root> Depends of what . 

<root> Ounces measure weight , pints measure volume . 

<root> If you mean fluid ounces , 20 , as opposed to the 16 in America . 

<root> An Irish pint is larger than a US one . 

<root> 20 fluid ounces in a Pint in Ireland 

<root> as R - G said , there are only 16 in an American one . 

<root> Know this well because I remember an ' irish ' pub in the town in canada i grew up in used to advertise the cheapest pints of guinness in town , but they served them in american sized pints . 

<root> That place did n't stay open too long :D 

<root> need help finding irish music ? 

<root> i love The Script and know the re from iraland . 

<root> i would like more bands like them pleasseee 

<root> The thing about The Script is they do not sound that Irish , I was surprised to hear they were from Dublin . 

<root> Well if you are interested , I suggest you have a look at General Fiasco , Two Door Cinema Club and Wallis Bird . 

<root> I think you will be pleased . 

<root> I doubt you will get a sensible answer in the " TRAVEL " section . 

<root> * Ireland 

<root> And there 's nothing distinctly Irish about them . 

<root> You 'd find similar bands to them that are from the UK and US . 

<root> Women 's rain coat ... where can I find one ? 

<root> I 'm going on a trip to Europe soon , and I need to find a good , quality raincoat . 

<root> I 've looked and looked , but can not find one anywhere ! 

<root> I would prefer a simple , fitted black one . 

<root> It actually needs to be relatively waterproof - the last one I bought had me soaked in anything more than light / moderate rain . 

<root> I 'll pay up to 200 - 250 for it if I have to . 

<root> Look on the debenhams website 

<root> in the craghoppers section 

<root> they do some good waterproof raincoats 

<root> here s the link : 

<root> http://www.debenhams.com/women/craghoppers#catalogId=10001&lid=//productsuniverse/en_GB/product_online0Y/categories%3C0productsuniverse_186610/brand_description0.000000E+000craghoppers0/categories%3C0productsuniverse_18661_186820&ps=default&sfn=Categories&sfv=Coats+%26amp0+jackets&storeId=10001 

<root> I have a Kodak Camera ( 10.2 Megapixels ) ... Kodak AF 5x OPTICAL LENS ... how do I pause it while recording ? 

<root> I have a Kodak Camera ( 10.2 Megapixels ) ... Kodak AF 5x OPTICAL LENS ... how do I pause it while recording ? 

<root> You do n't ... there 's no such thing as " pause " in digital recording . 

<root> That 's because of the buffer that holds the data until it 's ready to be recorded to the memory card . 

<root> When you press the button to stop recording the data is moved from the buffer to the memory card - no pause . 

<root> All you can do is take each section ( individual video ) and edit them together on software . 

<root> I have a Nacho Libre question .? 

<root> When nacho is driving to cure the influenza guy does he say to the man with the cow i like your blouse or I like your cow because my friend thinks he says I like your blouse , but that would n't make sense . 

<root> I know it s in the wrong catagory , but still , I wrote this question for a reason , not for you to critisize me . 

<root> Okay , FIRST , you have posted a question about an American movie , set in Mexico , in the Dining Out in Argentina category . 

<root> Do you get what 's wrong with this picture ? 

<root> No ... that 's all . 

<root> No second . 

<root> Nacho Libre is suppose to be inspired in Mexicans , not in Argentineans . 

<root> is there any good places to get an ice - cream sundae from in Invercargill New Zealand ? 

<root> so i live in Invercargill New Zealand and i want to know if there are any good places to buy an ice - cream sundae from other than mc donald s lol 

<root> Fast food chains , supermarkets , dairies 

<root> you live in NZ and you eat McDonald s ice cream ? 

<root> you 're mad ! 

<root> Any of the tip - top places have great ice - cream , get them to mix it up . 

<root> any Ice Cream In NZ no matter where as New Zealand has the best bl**dy ice cream in the world I was in NZ for a few weeks had some Ice Cream and really enjoyed it I will go back just to eat some Ice Cream 

<root> best burger chain in the Chicago area ? 

<root> which is the best burger chain in the chicago metro area like for example burger king portillo s white castle which one do like the best ? 

<root> Red Robin . 

<root> Onion Rings are great and the fries are endless . 

<root> Fudrucker s . 

<root> idk ur choice 

<root> Chain ? 

<root> Does 5 make a chain ? 

<root> Hackney 's has a great burger formula that started about 80 years ago . 

<root> There are currently 5 locations : 

<root> http://www.hackneys.net/ 

<root> The latest spot for a real Hackney 's is Printers ' Row : 

<root> http://www.hackneysprintersrow.net/ 

<root> See what DD & D showed at the original place on Harms Rd in Glenview : 

<root> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2lDF0XU3NI 

<root> Along with the great burger try a brick of onion rings if you are with someone . 

<root> Otherwise a 1/2 brick will be fine :

<root> My dog has threw up yellow bile for two days but does not have dhirea . 

<root> What should I do ? 

<root> I 've tried bland white rice but he wo nt eat anything . 

<root> What could it be ? 

<root> Should I be concerned ? 

<root> Call a vet would be a good idea with a sick dog 

<root> VERY CONCERNED !!! 

<root> plz bring your dog to the vet ASAP !!! 

<root> esp if not eating - if it had only happened once and could get him to eat right away - it could have been you missed his meal time and he needed to eat - since it sounds like it has happened several times over two days - then he may have gotten int to something that needs to be attended to RIGHT AWAY !!! 

<root> or has acquired some type of disease and that too needs to be attended to ... 

<root> why are there two statues of David ? 

<root> i doing a research paper on donatello and i notice that there are two statues of David , a bronze one and marble one . 

<root> Michelangelo made the marble one but why did he do another if Donatello had already made one ? 

<root> so i m a little confused , why is there two statues of David ? 

<root> different generations , the donatello is of a boy david as a young sheep Herder , the Michelangelo is the grown up man david as slayer and king 

<root> Because he liked making statues of David ! :D 

<root> Obviously , he should have been arrested and jailed - imagine making a statue or painting on the same subject as another artist - clearly insulting and disrespecting - wasted time that could have been used making a statue with clothes on . 

<root> Name of specific Hibachi restaurant in Chicago ? 

<root> I have a friend out in Chicago this week , and I am trying to remember the name of an awesome hibachi style restaurant i visited while out there a couple years ago . 

<root> I think it was in the Lincoln Square area but do n't quote me on that . 

<root> It's ' gimmick ' was that you fill your bowl cafeteria - style from raw ingredients and leave it on the counter with a chopstick listing your table number on it . 

<root> Four guys around a large square open hibachi cook your food , and when it 's finished a server brings it to your table . 

<root> All - you can - eat style deal . 

<root> It was pretty epic as I remember and would love to send my friend there . 

<root> Any help ? 

<root> That is Flat Top Grill 

<root> What 's the best time to start a trip around the world ? 

<root> Well , I 'm about to graduate in less then a year , and I 'm planning to study medical school . 

<root> But since in my country it lasts for minimum 6 years , and I want to go aground the world , what do you think , should I do it before or after medical school ? 

<root> If you can afford to go before , then by all means , GO . 

<root> If you have to wait , due to financial reasons , then wait . 

<root> I would much rather put it off until I can afford to have the vacation of a lifetime as I 'm sure this trip is intended to be . 

<root> Airfare alone will be incredibly expensive so make sure you have the money and of course free time to take your time and have a great time . 

<root> canon t2i stops working ? 

<root> My canon t2i stops working at times as in the power bottom is switched to " on " but the camera does not respond to any function . 

<root> the camera only begins to work again when i take out the battery and put it back in . 

<root> did anyone have this issue ? 

<root> is it worthy to send in for warranty repair ? 

<root> thanks ! 

<root> Sounds simple enough to me . 

<root> Your camera is n't acting normally , you got warranty , let Canon deal with it . 

<root> I would agree . 

<root> I shoot a t1i and have n't had such an issue . 

<root> I also agree it 's under warranty so get in touch with Canon . 

<root> It sounds like a firmware issue and the camera requires a re-boot just like what happens in a computer - needs a re-start from time to time but it should n't be happening in a camera . 

<root> Call Canon 

<root> Cheapest airline ticket from Raleigh to Philippines ? 

<root> I 'm going on a vacation to the Philippines in May 2012 , and I 'm starting from Raleigh , NC ( RDU Airport ) . 

<root> Which airlines should I look into and when should I buy my ticket ? 

<root> The sooner the better but I 'd probably wait until after the holidays . 

<root> Use Travelocity or Expedia and see what you come up with . 

<root> My friend goes to the Phils every 6 months or so and she has found that Korean Air has had the cheapest fares lately . 

<root> Raleigh to Chicago , Chicago to Seoul and then Seoul to Manila . 

<root> Compare compare compare - that 's the key to getting the best deal . 

<root> Ask a travel agent ! 

<root> On my last 6 trips here from the states I used " Fly genesis " based in Seattle , Wa . 

<root> They gave the best service & rates I could find . 

<root> What is the best place to get discounts for San Francisco restaurants ? 

<root> I just moved into the city , and I 'm wondering if there 's a place I can get good deals on restaurants here . 

<root> I do n't want to have to deal with those deal - a - day websites like Groupon . 

<root> I just want a simple way to get a good deal to whatever Restaurant I want , whenever I want . 

<root> Any suggestions would be really helpful , thanks ! 

<root> I usually use ZebraKlub . 

<root> They basically buy daily deals from Groupon , Living Social , and all sorts of other places . 

<root> So you can pretty much get whatever deal you want anytime . 

<root> Most of the deals let you eat for 500 ff , and some of the deals are even free . 

<root> If you want to eat cheaply without worrying about all those daily deal emails every day , ZebraKlub should be perfect for you . 

<root> Where can I go on a first date ( adults ) ? 

<root> Looking for something on the casual side and we want it to be fun . 

<root> May seem a little silly , but , taking a long ride on the Metra system or the " L " system is a great way to see the city and sites without spending a fortune . 

<root> Or how about visiting the Chicago Botanical Gardens and see the change of colors and enjoy the air , They also have many inside exhibits you might enjoy , food is pretty good to . 

<root> go 2 starbucks do nt spend more than 20 bucks :) 

<root> Bike ride in the park , followed by coffee . 

<root> You are busy , you do n't have to sit face to face to try 

<root> to make convo , it 's short , so if things go great , you can 

<root> extend , and if you want to end it , you just say bye , 

<root> got ta go . 

<root> I decided to get a 150 gal aquarium , what can I fill it with ? 

<root> I was thinking cichlids ? 

<root> Possibly a freshwater tank with a ton of different species in there . 

<root> I 've never kept cichlids though . 

<root> I know saltwater is a possibility , can you give me a possible stocking option for that too ? 

<root> I 'll choose the one that sounds the best after looking into all the fish :) 

<root> Here is the stocking for my 150 gallon tank i upgraded it to 200 at the weekend because of the clownloach A 200 gallon with 6 pairs of Breeding Angel fish fire mouth honey Gouramis 5 8 inch clownloach a Krib and 5 1 inch clown loach with 16 cory cats 5 Australian Rainbows 

<root> If you took out the clown loach it would make a nice 150 gallon tank . 

<root> fill it with water :) lol 

<root> for a tank that size i would suggest oscars or piranha every time awesome fish !! 

<root> never response the phone call 

<root> Great deals , great pizza !

<root> DO Nt Go here 

<root> Restaurant on top was renovated , food was decent , price was way to high for Duluth for quality , new decor seems tacky 

<root> Rude and Untrustworthy 

<root> These guys took Customer Service 101 from a Neanderthal . 

<root> They are especially rude to women . 

<root> Do not trust them ! 

<root> Good food , good location , and good prices . 

<root> But the servers do n't pay attention to you whether it 's busy or not . 

<root> One of the better vegetarian sandwiches I 've had in Seattle .

<root> Best Electrician in Florence 

<root> I have been using Steele Electric for years . 

<root> They have always done a great job at a reasonable price . 

<root> Highly recommended . 

<root> Not impressed . 

<root> Overpriced and the doctor acted arrogant and rushed at a time when there was very few clients in the facility . 

<root> I wo n't return . 

<root> A thoroughly comprehensive service ; excellent communication and best of they are transparent with their fee ( ie nothing is simply implied or assumed ) . 

<root> I gave Dr. Rohatgi 2 stars because her assistant was very pleasant . 

<root> However , I did not find her very helpful and her receptionist was rude . 

<root> Extremely greasy . 

<root> Hit or miss on the service . 

<root> My fries were n't fully cooked last time I went there . 

<root> Pretty spendy for really not great quality 

<root> The management and staff are superb . 

<root> I worked with Sam Mones who took great care of me .

<root> house closing 

<root> Mrs. Tolchin provided us with excellent service and came with a great deal of knowledge and professionalism ! 

<root> Her flexibility and accessibility made for an easy closing .

<root> Out of business ? 

<root> I think this location is no longer in business . 

<root> If you check RecWarehouse.com , they do n't list this as a location . 

<root> You 'll have to drive 10 miles down 75 to Allen . 

<root> Awesome Landscaping Job

<root> I do n't recommend this place to anyone or even anything to eat . 

<root> Not so good 

<root> Not worth the money . 

<root> Bland and over cooked . 

<root> I felt as if I was in an over priced Olive Garden . 

<root> I was hoping to have found a regular place to eat . 

<root> But not so . 

<root> I have used Bright Futures for the last 7 years .

<root> no feathers in stock !!!! 

<root> I was very upset when I went to Mother Plucker , they had NO FEATHERS and the quality is TERRIBLE . 

<root> I had to dig in a bag to find one nice feather , what a joke ! 

<root> Gets the Job Done 

<root> We have utilized Mr. Pozza and his firm twice now in our family and both times have been very pleased . 

<root> I would not hesitate to use him again or refer him to my family or friends . 

<root> Farrell Electric is a very good electrical contractor . 

<root> I 'm pleased that someone referred me to them for my commercial business . 

<root> I own a property management firm and need a contractor with the credentials that Farrell Electric has . 

<root> Cleanest guesthouse i have been to 

<root> Stayed here for 2 nights . 

<root> The owner was very friendly and helpful . 

<root> The rooms were very clean and the breakfast was excellent . 

<root> Good location and off road parking made our stay very convenient . 

<root> These guys do great work at VERY reasonable prices . 

<root> I have use them four times for fixing items from pushing out a dent in a bumper to fixing the fender on my beloved Miata . 

<root> I have never been disappointed . 

<root> Do n't waste your money on the jukebox 

<root> The bartender is a douchebag and he has a little console behind the bar where he can delete songs he does n't like , and you end up paying for it . 

<root> Not enough seating . 

<root> spoken english rushi 

<root> can ever & never forget the training undergone here which made my life step onto the successful job without any hurdles . 

<root> The staff , material provided , infra structure , environment & low fees totally above the satisfactory mark 

<root> Rubbish 

<root> Took 1 + hour to deliver to Chatham , hair in food , driver did n't know area . 

<root> Noticed a few of these Cookie cutter places opening in Summit and New Providence . 

<root> Stick to Hop Hing , 20 year + resident . 

<root> Great place 

<root> Really great service and kind staff . 

<root> The haircut was inexpensive and so were the salon services ( eyebrows were cheap ! ) . 

<root> It 's a nice , relaxed place to get stuff done and relax . 

<root> I plan on going again . 

<root> Amazing customer service 

<root> I think the women at this salon know that their business is based primarily from referrals . :) 

<root> They were amazingly hospitable . 

<root> Edit was the best massage therapist I 've ever had and I would HIGHLY recommend her ! 

<root> good outside , bad inside 

<root> the apartment only looks good outsize , inside is too bad . 

<root> too many bugs some you even never seen before . 

<root> the attitude of some staff is terrible , did not solve anything only say i can do nothing . 

<root> great tmobile service 

<root> I was with verizon and I checked my service with tmobile and it was great so I thought I would try tmobile . 

<root> It turned out being very good quality tmobile service and I was happy with the new tmobile phone . 

<root> Walgreens on University 

<root> My pharmacy order is always correct and promptly delivered but the pharmacy staff are always very short with me and do n't seem to like answering questions .

<root> I love them !!! 

<root> BEST DENTIST EVER - 

<root> Very fast and efficient service . 

<root> I have had several dentists in my life , but Dr. Deters is by far my favorite . 

<root> I never wait in the waiting room more than two minutes and the cleanings are quick and painless . 

<root> This is a great place to shop . 

<root> I 've been a regular customer at this store since it opened , and love the fact that all of the employees are friendly locals . 

<root> Particularly the lady who operates the front register , she 's very kind ! 

<root> AMAZING 

<root> Absoul is the greatest donair man on the planet .

<root> Lest you be lame !!! 

<root> I give this place 11 / 10 . 

<root> 3 thumbs up . 

<root> Bon appetit ! 

<root> Great quality doors and great quality people ! 

<root> The door is easy to use and it keeps the cold out during the winter . 

<root> The sales staff and the installation staff were all easy to get along with . 

<root> I highly recommend Garage Pros to my friends . 

<root> umm ... 

<root> okay , I do nt have a review , but why in the hell would you name your business something that has the initials KKK .... is there something behind the scenes at this place ? 

<root> Like I 'm legitimately concerned at this point ... lol 

<root> Fresh and Excellent Quality 

<root> We order take out from here all the time and we are never disappointed . 

<root> The food is always fresh and delicious . 

<root> It can be a little on the spicy side but just ask them exactly what you want and they are very helpful . 

<root> I really want to like this place since I work right around the corner . 

<root> Unfortunately , I 've given it a couple of tries at different times and decided to stop going . 

<root> The employees do n't really seem to enjoy what they are doing and it shows . 

<root> Class act . 

<root> It was late in the day and I was worried I would get charged an arm and a leg and have to wait forever . 

<root> They picked my car up in Yarmouth and towed to Bath for a great price . 

<root> Would do business with them again . 

<root> Great service 

<root> We at R&L Plumbing Services are pleased with your professionalism and the extra mile you went to get out computers working correctly , you will be our first call if anything happens again and we will refer you to other people with computer issues . 

<root> Do n't judge a book by its cover 

<root> From the outside Ichiban looks like it will be terrible . 

<root> This could n't be farther from the truth . 

<root> The food is amazing , and the prices can not be beat . 

<root> The sushi is great , and they have a great selection . 

<root> Great work ! 

<root> The people at Gulf Coast Siding were very easy and clear to work with . 

<root> They walked me through all the steps involved in the the installation project so that there were no surprises . 

<root> I found them extremely professional and would highly recommend them . 

<root> Thanks 

<root> Natasha 

<root> A real pleasure training with Natasha . 

<root> Always professional and reliable , sessions are good fun and suitably challenging . 

<root> She really listens to what it is you would like to achieve , and I am very happy with my results . 

<root> I would highly recommend her services . 

<root> slow service 

<root> I used to take my cars there all the time , but management changes hands too frequently , the service has been slow , and they often try to " add on " extra services , which sometimes is not needed . 

<root> I do nt go there anymore 

<root> Great service 

<root> These people were so helpful this week and did everything to sort out my windscreen and insurance . 

<root> It was all sorted with no hassle at all and I 'm really grateful - they were fab . 

<root> The best customer service I 've come across for long time . 

<root> Absolutely amazing job ! 

<root> Susanna is the best dress maker / tailor I 've ever come across in my whole life ! 

<root> She makes every item fit you perfectly . 

<root> She is always so busy , too , which is a good indication of her talent . 

<root> She 's the best ! 

<root> teeth 

<root> this dentist want to pull the tooth out always .. always wants to do the cheapest for his benefit .. not unless he knows you . 

<root> and hopefully you do not know the same people because he tells others about you payment status . 

<root> Which should be a private issue 

<root> I hired this company to unlock my car . 

<root> The price they gave was good so I said hey this seems great . 

<root> After they showed up there was a little trouble to get my car unlocked , it took quite a bit of time but the job was well done . 

<root> Bulwark regarding service by Eric 

<root> Just wanted you to know that Eric came by as scheduled today and sprayed our house for scorpions . 

<root> He seemed to understand how important it was for us to make sure the whole house was sprayed so he took his time . 

<root> Thank you ! 

<root> A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE ! 

<root> I remain unhappy . 

<root> I still have noticeable scarring . 

<root> I still have surgically induced hair loss . 

<root> My results were just AWFUL . 

<root> My post-op treatment was TERRIBLE . 

<root> I would n't recommend this place last year , and I certainly would n't recommend them this year . 

<root> Hidden Treasure . 

<root> Strip mall asian it is not ! 

<root> Go in and you will not think you are in Chesapeake . 

<root> The setting feels like a Sushi bar in NYC ; small , cozy , but with flair . 

<root> Get great service , fantastic menu , and relax . 

<root> Best in HR so far ! 

<root> Excellent medical care !!!!!! 

<root> Highly recommend 

<root> I went to this urgent care center and was blown away with their service . 

<root> Finally a convenient place close to home . 

<root> Wonderful staff and physician . 

<root> Clean and superb . 

<root> Thanks for the great care !!!! 

<root> Will definitely go back when I need medical care . 

<root> excellence in glasgow 

<root> I v just had my bmw z3 rear window replaced by the guys at kelvin trimmers . 

<root> The team who work there are helpfull , friendly and extremely knowledgeable and will help you as much as they can with thier years of hands on practice . 

<root> Highly recomended . 

<root> My favorite place ... 

<root> My daughter and I stayed here again from the 7th to the 14th of December . 

<root> yet again it was a great stay from begiinning to end . 

<root> Okay our room was at times noisy but we were in a mega busy city at an extremely busy time of year . 

<root> A Definite No 

<root> Incompetent servers , kitchen and management . 

<root> Expect either undercooked or mushy food and lackluster service . 

<root> The investors put big bucks into the building but are clueless about what makes a good dining or bar experience . 

<root> Even the least discriminating diner would know not to eat at Sprecher 's . 

<root> Wonderful Atmosphere 

<root> I have been going there since I was a little girl and love the friendly and relaxing atmosphere . 

<root> Dr. Stiefvater has always been very professional and helpful . 

<root> I would recommend Bayside Chiropractic to anyone who is in need of a regular adjustment or is suffering from a chronic condition . 

<root> Channel Guide 

<root> Believe it or not , but the channel guide has been most helpful to my family members that visit and do n't know where to start when it comes to watching satellite tv . 

<root> I just give them guide and they can find anything they need . 

<root> Thanks again , Directv . 

<root> Michael helped shoot the majority of my firm 's website and we could not have been happier . 

<root> We went through six photographers to find the right photographers that would represent our firm in the light we wished to and Michael and his team made that happen . 

<root> He 's worth every penny . 

<root> Average food and deathly slow service 

<root> I have eaten here several times and every time the service is slower than slow . 

<root> One time we even left after sitting at the table for 20 minutes and not being greeted with a drink order . 

<root> Ridiculous . 

<root> There must be a better mexican place in Rockland . 

<root> I am in love with the giant plate of nachos ! 

<root> Last time I went however , my beer was warm and the service was so - so . 

<root> I get that careless teenager kind of treatment from some of their staff ... perhaps they should hire more serious adults to help serve / cook . 

<root> nice friendly local bagel place 

<root> there might be bigger and more well known bagel places in the area but Family Bagels are nice people , small shop and incredibly friendly . 

<root> While other may be ok waiting in line at Town Bagel we are happy with the quality and service we get at Family Bagels 

<root> Very Mediocre donuts ! 

<root> The Donuts were very over proofed , making them stale and bready . 

<root> The service was friendly and fast , but this just does nt make up for the lack - luster product . 

<root> We tried 4 different style of donuts , they were all the same when it came to quality . 

<root> a staple ! 

<root> I live in the neighborhood and this place is one of my favorites for a tasty , quick and inexpensive meal . 

<root> Branch out and try something other than the Pad Thai , the curries are fantastic . 

<root> Fast and friendly service , they know my order when I walk in the door ! 

<root> On time , Clean and very nice 

<root> I called over the weekend due to clogged kitchen sink . 

<root> Scheduled appointment for 8:30 Monday morning . 

<root> Rich was here before the scheduled time . 

<root> He was very clean , very nice to work with and gave a very reasonable price . 

<root> HIGHLY recommend . 

<root> thanks Rich 

<root> Seth K . 

<root> Deep tissue massage helps with pain in neck and shoulders 

<root> Seth provides deep tissue massage which has significantly reduced the pain in my neck and shoulders and added flexibility and movement back to the area . 

<root> He listens and is excellent in diagnosing , addressing and explaining the specific issues and suggesting exercises to use .
