<root> Introduction 

<root> Research on adult-learned second language ( L2 ) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [ 1 ] – [ 11 ] . 

<root> Of interest here , studies suggest that , despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar , adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [ 12 ] – [ 15 ] . 

<root> However , it is not enough to have attained such native-like levels . 

<root> Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 . 

<root> In fact , substantial periods ( months to years ) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon , and may even be the norm [ 16 ] . 

<root> Such a scenario may be found in different situations , including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [ 19 ] . 

<root> In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar : that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native-like neural processes ( “ use it or lose it ” [ 20 ] ) , no such changes , or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native-like processing may be observed . 

<root> Additionally , we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts . 

<root> Previous Research 

<root> We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] , all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral ( performance ) outcomes . 

<root> ( Note that we do not consider case studies , purely observational data , or research on L2s acquired by children ; for a comprehensive review , see [ 16 ] ) . 

<root> The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] or lexical abilities [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] . 

<root> These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [ 21 ] , with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [ 24 ] . 

<root> Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] or mixed classroom and immersion training [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 

<root> The training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years , and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels ( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] ) prior to the period of limited exposure . 

<root> Overall , the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following . 

<root> A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition ( loss ) of L2 performance or knowledge [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] . 

<root> Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] , though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier [ 17 ] . 

<root> Although attrition may take place within the first few years , some studies suggest that it then appears to level off , with no further losses occurring [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] . 

<root> Higher levels of proficiency ( or exposure ) may be associated with less attrition [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] or even with no observed losses [ 21 ] . 

<root> Moreover , one study found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [ 22 ] . 

<root> Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] . 

<root> It remains unclear what might explain such gains , which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [ 24 ] , or to factors related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training [ 18 ] . 

<root> Digital Humanities Clinics - 

<root> Leading Dutch Librarians into DH 

<root> Michiel Cock m.p.cock@vu.nl Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , the Netherlands 

<root> Lotte Wilms lotte.wilms@kb.nl National Library of the Netherlands , the Netherlands 

<root> In 2015 , an initiative was started to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and Belgium , based on the example of the American communal space of librarians , archivists , LIS graduate students , and information specialists to discuss topics ‘ Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet ’ . 

<root> At the initial meeting it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not ( yet ) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject . 

<root> On the administrative level , the directors of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries ( UKB ) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH . 

<root> A year later , the National Library of the Netherlands ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field . 

<root> Therefore both institutes joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians . 

<root> The two institutes were later joined by the Leiden University Libraries . 

<root> We see this as the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians , but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries . 

<root> In essence , we want to teach our country ’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects . 

<root> The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in DH , for a diverse group of librarians , consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills . 

<root> The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students , identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and ( perhaps ) to automate their daily library work . 

<root> We are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers , but want to boost their knowledge level to where they feel comfortable providing information about DH projects , follow the literature and research , follow online tutorials and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development by engaging with the DH community . 

<root> In order to design this curriculum we follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud - principle ( Williams , 2010 ) : 

<root> Desk research about what being a DH librarian entails ( e.g. Hartsell-Gundy et al. , 2015 ; Mulligan , 2016 ; also see the Zotero library of the LIBER Digital Humanities working group ) ; 

<root> Identify possible subjects , based on experience , a comparison of existing teaching material related to DH ( e.g. The Programming Historian , the Digital Scholarship Training Programme at the British Library and Columbia University 's Developing Librarian project ) and the TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities ; 

<root> Get feedback from researchers on possible subjects , based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need ; 

<root> Get feedback from librarians on possible subjects , based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills . 

<root> With these in hand , we will design the curriculum of clinics , based on the method of ' constructive alignment ' ( Biggs et al. , 2011 ) , to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching / learning activities stay aligned . 

<root> Our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics , each one full day . 

<root> Each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers , that address the conceptual knowledge needed . 

<root> The afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills , following the Library Carpentry model as closely as possible . 

<root> By having researchers provide the lecture sessions , we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities . 

<root> With these clinics , we hope to initiate a stream of DH activities in Dutch universities , making access to support easier for new digital scholars . 

<root> The poster at DH2017 will present the curriculum , its position in the international context and offer the lessons learned from both the design process and the first clinics . 

<root> We welcome discussion about our efforts and the possibilities of applying this in other contexts . 

<root> Education and early loves 

<root> Byron received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School , and in August 1799 entered the school of Dr. William Glennie , in Dulwich . [ 17 ] 

<root> Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey , he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but not restrain himself from " violent " bouts in an attempt to overcompensate for his deformed foot . 

<root> His mother interfered with his studies , often withdrawing him from school , with the result that he lacked discipline and his classical studies were neglected . 

<root> In 1801 , he was sent to Harrow , where he remained until July 1805 . [ 6 ] 

<root> An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer , he did represent the school during the very first Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord 's in 1805 . [ 19 ] 

<root> His lack of moderation was not restricted to physical exercise . 

<root> Byron fell in love with Mary Chaworth , whom he met while at school , [ 6 ] and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 . 

<root> His mother wrote , " He has no indisposition that I know of but love , desperate love , the worst of all maladies in my opinion . In short , the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth . " [ 6 ] 

<root> In Byron 's later memoirs , " Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings . " [ 20 ] 

<root> Byron finally returned in January 1804 , [ 6 ] to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys , which he recalled with great vividness : " My school friendships were with me passions ( for I was always violent ) . " [ 21 ] 

<root> The most enduring of those was with John FitzGibbon , 2nd Earl of Clare — four years Byron 's junior — whom he was to meet unexpectedly many years later in Italy ( 1821 ) . [ 22 ] 

<root> His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships , Childish Recollections ( 1806 ) , express a prescient " consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him . " [ 23 ] 

<root> Letters to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short-lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow , John Thomas Claridge . 

<root> John FitzGibbon , 2nd Earl of Clare 

<root> Ah ! 

<root> Sure some stronger impulse vibrates here , Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear To one , who thus for kindred hearts must roam , And seek abroad , the love denied at home . 

<root> The following autumn , he went up to Trinity College , Cambridge , [ 24 ] where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston . 

<root> About his " protégé " he wrote , " He has been my almost constant associate since October , 1805 , when I entered Trinity College . His voice first attracted my attention , his countenance fixed it , and his manners attached me to him for ever . " 

<root> In his memory Byron composed Thyrza , a series of elegies . [ 25 ] 

<root> In later years , he described the affair as " a violent , though pure love and passion " . 

<root> This statement , however , needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions ( including public hanging ) against convicted or even suspected offenders . [ 26 ] 

<root> The liaison , on the other hand , may well have been " pure " out of respect for Edleston 's innocence , in contrast to the ( probably ) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School . [ 27 ] 

<root> Byron spent three years at Trinity College , engaging in sexual escapades , boxing , horse riding and gambling . [ 28 ] 

<root> Also while at Cambridge he formed lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse , who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club , which endorsed liberal politics , [ 28 ] and Francis Hodgson , a Fellow at King 's College , with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life . 

<root> Emperor Norton 

<root> Joshua Abraham Norton ( c. 1818 – January 8 , 1880 ) , known as Emperor Norton , was a citizen of San Francisco , California , who in 1859 proclaimed himself " Norton I , Emperor of the United States " . 

<root> He later expanded his pretense by claiming to be " Protector of Mexico " as well . 

<root> Born in England , Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa . 

<root> After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848 , he sailed west , arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849 . 

<root> Norton initially made a living as a businessman , but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice . 

<root> After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract , Norton 's public prominence faded . 

<root> He reemerged in September 1859 , laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States . 

<root> He had no political power , and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him ; 

<root> nevertheless , he was treated deferentially in San Francisco , and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented . 

<root> Though some considered him insane or eccentric , citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations , such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland , and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay . 

<root> Long after his death , similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube , and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge " The Emperor Norton Bridge " . 

<root> On January 8 , 1880 , Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont ( now Grant ) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment . 

<root> Nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral . 

<root> Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of writers Mark Twain , Robert Louis Stevenson , Christopher Moore , Morris and Goscinny , Selma Lagerlöf , and Neil Gaiman . 

<root> Norton I , Emperor of the United States , photograph , c. 1871 – 72 

<root> Declares himself emperor 

<root> Emperor Joshua Norton , in full military regalia , circa 1880 or earlier 

<root> By 1859 , Norton had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States . 

<root> On September 17 , 1859 , he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city , proclaiming himself " Emperor of these United States " : 

<root> At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States , I , Joshua Norton , formerly of Algoa Bay , Cape of Good Hope , and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S.F. , Cal. , declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U.S. ; 

<root> and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested , do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical Hall , of this city , on the 1st day of Feb. next , then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring , and thereby cause confidence to exist , both at home and abroad , in our stability and integrity . 

<root> — NORTON I , Emperor of the United States . 

<root> The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin . 

<root> Norton would later add " Protector of Mexico " to this title . 

<root> Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year " reign " over America . 

<root> One of Norton 's undated proclamations 

<root> In his self-appointed role of emperor , Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state . 

<root> After assuming absolute control over the country , he saw no further need for a legislature , and on October 12 , 1859 , he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress . 

<root> In it , Norton observed : 

<root> ... fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice ; 

<root> that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring , caused by mobs , parties , factions and undue influence of political sects ; 

<root> that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled . 

<root> Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt 's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to " remedy the evil complained of " . 

<root> In an imperial decree the following month , Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress : 

<root> WHEREAS , a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City , in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last , declaring the said Congress abolished ; 

<root> WHEREAS , it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with ; 

<root> NOW , THEREFORE , we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott , the Command-in-Chief of our Armies , immediately upon receipt of this , our Decree , to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress . 

<root> The Beast 

<root> I was thirteen . 

<root> It was spring , the barren time in March when you can not be sure if it is really warmer , but you are so desperate for change that you tell yourself the mud at the edge of the sidewalk is different from winter mud and you are sure that the smell of wet soil has suddenly a bit of the scent of summer rains , of grass and drowned earthworms . 

<root> And it has , because it is spring and inside the ground something is stirring . 

<root> I was wearing a yellow linen dress which my mother had picked out and which I therefore disliked although I knew it flattered me . 

<root> My shoes were white and I was concentrating on keeping them out of the mud . 

<root> My father and I were going to mass — my mother did not go ; she was Protestant . 

<root> My father put his hand on top of my hair , his palm on my head , and I could feel the bone of my skull and my skin and his hot palm , so dry and strong . 

<root> When I was a little girl , he did that often , and called me Muscles . 

<root> He had not called me Muscles or put his hand on my head for a long time . 

<root> I could not help arching my back a little , I wanted to push against his hand like a cat but the instinct that comes with being thirteen , the half-understood caution that makes a girl timid , or wild , the shyness told me to just walk . 

<root> I wanted to feel the rough edge of the pocket of his coat against my cheek , but I was too tall . 

<root> I wanted to be seven again , and safe . 

<root> But I still wanted to push against his hand and put my hand in his pocket and steal the leather palmed glove , that secret animal . 

<root> Instead I went into the church , took a Bulletin , dipped my finger in Holy Water and genuflected . 

<root> The inside of the church smelled like damp wood and furniture polish , not alive at all . 

<root> My father took off his coat and draped it over the edge of the pew and when I came back from communion I stole his glove . 

<root> The paper taste of the wafer was still in my mouth and I took a deep breath of the leather . 

<root> It smelled like March . 

<root> We walked back through the school because it was drizzling , my father tall in his navy suit and my shoes going click on the linoleum . 

<root> There were two classes of each grade , starting at the sixth and going down to the first . 

<root> The hall ended in a T and we went left through the gym , walked underneath the bleachers and stood next to the side door , waiting for the rain to stop . 

<root> It was dark under the bleachers . 

<root> My father was a young man , thirty-five , younger because he liked to be outside , to play softball on Saturday and to take my mother and me camping on vacation . 

<root> He stood rocked back on his heels with his coat thrown over his shoulders and his hands in his pockets . 

<root> I thought of bacon and eggs , toast with peach jam out of the jar . 

<root> I was so hungry . 

<root> The space under the bleachers was secret and dark . 

<root> There were things in the shadows ; a metal pail , a mop , rags . 

<root> Next to the door was a tall wrought-iron candle holder — the kind that stood at either end of the altar . 

<root> There was no holder and the end was jagged . 

<root> On the floor was a wrapper from a French Chew . 

<root> They were sold at eighth-grade basketball games on Friday nights . 

<root> The light from the door made the shadows under the bleachers darker , the long space stretched far away . 

<root> I heard the rain and the faint rustle of paper and smelled damp concrete . 

<root> I did not go near my father but kept my hand in my pocket , feeling the soft leather glove . 

<root> There was a rustling on the concrete and the drizzle of soft rain . 

<root> I wondered if anyone ever went back under the bleachers , if there were crickets or mice there . 

<root> The rustling might have been mice . 

<root> I wished the rain would stop . 

<root> I wanted to go home . 

<root> I made noises with my heels but they were too loud so I stopped . 

<root> Something else clicked and I tried to see what it was but could n’t see anything . 

<root> It was n’t as loud as my heels . 

<root> My father cleared his throat , looking out the door . 

<root> I imagined a man down there in the dark , an escaped convict or a madman . 

<root> It had nearly stopped raining . 

<root> In fifteen minutes we would be home and my mother would fry eggs . 

<root> I heard a noise like paper . 

<root> My father heard it , too , but he pretended not to , at least he did n’t turn his head . 

<root> And there was a heavier sound , a rasp , like a box pulled over concrete . 

<root> I looked at my father but he did n’t turn his head . 

<root> I wished he would turn his head . 

<root> There was a click again and the rustle , and I could not think of what it could be . 

<root> I had no explanation for the particular combination of sounds . 

<root> No doubt there was , some two things that happened to be making noises at the same time . 

<root> Once in a fever I heard thousands of birds outside my window and I was terrified that they would fling themselves through the glass and attack me , but it was only the rain on the eaves . 

<root> Chapter Two : Master Lunre 

<root> My father ’s actions were largely incomprehensible to me , guided by his own secret and labyrinthine calculations . 

<root> He dwelt in another world , a world of intrigue , bargains , contracts and clandestine purchases of land all over the island . 

<root> He was in many ways a world in himself , whole as a sphere . 

<root> No doubt his decisions were perfectly logical in his own eyes — even the one that prompted him , a patriotic islander , to bring me a tutor from Bain : Master Lunre , an Olondrian . 

<root> The day began as it usually did when my father was expected home from his travels , the house festooned with flowers and stocked with coconut liquor . 

<root> We stood by the gate , washed and perfumed and arrayed in our brightest clothes , my mother twisting her hands in her skirt , my father ’s wife with red eyes . 

<root> Jom , grown taller and broad in the shoulders , moaned gently to himself , while I stood nervously rubbing the heel of one sandal on the flagstones . 

<root> We scanned the deep blue valley for the first sign of the company , but before we saw them we heard the children shouting : “ A yellow man ! ” 

<root> A yellow man ! 

<root> We glanced at one another in confusion . 

<root> My mother bit her lower lip ; Jom gave a groan of alarm . 

<root> At first I thought the children meant my father , whose golden skin , the color of the night-monkey ’s pelt , was a rarity in the islands ; but certainly the children of Tyom were familiar with my father , and would never have greeted a council-member with such ill-mannered yells . 

<root> Then I remembered the only “ yellow man ” I had ever seen , an Olondrian wizard and doctor who had visited Tyom in my childhood , who wore two pieces of glass on his eyes , attached to his ears with wires , and roamed the hills of Tinimavet , cutting bits off the trees . 

<root> I have since learned that that doctor wrote a well-received treatise , On the Medicinal Properties of the Juice of the Young Coconut , and died a respected man in his native city of Deinivel ; but at the time I felt certain he had returned with his sack of tree-cuttings . 

<root> “ There they are , ” said Pavit , the head house-servant , in a strained voice . 

<root> And there they were : a chain of riders weaving among the trees . 

<root> My father ’s plaited umbrella appeared , his still , imposing figure , and beside him another man , tall and lean , astride an island mule . 

<root> The hectic screams of the children preceded the company into the village , so that they advanced like a festival , drawing people out of their houses . 

<root> As they approached I saw that my father ’s face was shining with pride , and his bearing had in it a new hauteur , like that of the old island kings . 

<root> The man who rode beside him , looking uncomfortable with his long legs , kept his gaze lowered and fixed between the ears of his plodding mule . 

<root> He was not yellow , but very pale brown , the color of raw cashews ; he had silver hair , worn cropped close to the skull so that it resembled a cap . 

<root> He was not the leaf-collecting doctor , but an altogether strange man , with silver eyebrows in his smooth face and long fine-knuckled hands . 

<root> As he dismounted in front of the house I heard my mother whispering : “ Protect us , God with the Black-and-White Tail , from that which is not of this earth . ” 

<root> My father dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us , grinning . 

<root> I thought I caught an odor off him , of fish , sea-sickness and sweat . 

<root> We knelt and stared down at the bald ground , murmuring ritual greetings , until he touched the tops of our heads with the palm of his fleshy hand . 

<root> Then we stood , unable to keep from staring at the stranger , who faced us awkwardly , half-smiling , taller than any man there . 

<root> Wikinews interviews meteorological experts on Cyclone Phalin 

<root> File photo of interviewee David Titley . 

<root> Image : David Titley . 

<root> Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h , as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength ? 

<root> Yes , all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters . 

<root> Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land , the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate . 

<root> As of the last advisory , T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland , headed on a northwest track . 

<root> That is a Category 3 storm . 

<root> The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours . 

<root> However , there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path . 

<root> Yes , it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land . 

<root> This occurs for two reasons : 

<root> As it moves over land , it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [ which is ] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface ; 

<root> Increased friction - the ocean surface is much , much smoother than the land surface . 

<root> Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat , which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain . 

<root> As tropical cyclones make landfall , this energy source is cut-off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land . 

<root> Yes , the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land . 

<root> Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land . 

<root> In the mean time , much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength . 

<root> Yes . 

<root> All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall . 

<root> However , they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides , and river flooding . 

<root> Phailin 's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland . 

<root> Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength . 

<root> However , and this is important , it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty .

<root> A previous cyclone in 1999 in the Bay of Bengal area of India left 10,000 people dead . 

<root> Is the Indian government well prepared to deal with this cyclone ? 

<root> I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm . 

<root> However , historically , there have been several events that should cause a societal response . 

<root> Hopefully , we all learn from past mistakes . 

<root> The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable , with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed , millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US$ 10 billion . 

<root> I do n't have enough information to answer this question , one way or the other . 

<root> From all the press reports that I have read , the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed . 

<root> The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past . 

<root> The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate . 

<root> Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out , which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations . 

<root> Unfortunately , extensive property damage is bound to occur even with the best preparation . 

<root> My knowledge of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space . 

<root> I heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history . 

<root> This shall be applauded given the size and strength of Phailin . 

<root> I visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [ ... ] sponsored by the Indian government . 

<root> Given the living standard and residence of people living near the coastal areas in this region , the evacuation is certainly necessary and essential to save lives . 

<root> I cannot comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone . 

<root> However , the news reports ( BBC etc. ) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding . 

<root> Water is the main killer in these storms . 

<root> From all reports that I have seen , the government was well prepared for this cyclone . 

<root> For this question I do n't know the ' preparedness ' of the Indian gov't to deal with this . 

<root> Wikinews interviews Mario J. Lucero and Isabel Ruiz of Heaven Sent Gaming 

<root> General questions 

<root> What is Heaven Sent Gaming ? 

<root> Heaven Sent Gaming is basically me and Isabel , I 'm Mario J. Lucero . 

<root> And , I 'm Isabel Ruiz . 

<root> And , together we formed this thing , it 's sort of like an entertainment team . 

<root> We started it basically , because I wanted to - I wanted to work with Isabel on a lot of projects that we had going on together . 

<root> We were coming with comics , like , left and right , we were coming up with things like Karis , in high school she came up with that one , I came up with an individual story called Thad 's World Destruction and , she wanted to illustrate it , and so , that 's the way we ended up doing it . 

<root> Yep , we like to just make our own original content , and , yep , that 's what we wanted to do . 

<root> How did you two meet ? 

<root> We met back in high school . 

<root> In this private , tiny-tiny private school of 50 students . 

<root> But , before hand in middle school , I kept on hearing about this guy named Mario , and he kept on hearing about me , this girl named Isabel . 

<root> And , everyone , all of our friends and all of our acquaintances would say , " Hey , you 'd get along with him really well . " 

<root> So before hand I kinda knew about him , but I never met him . 

<root> And one of our friends , our common friends , he introduced us during study hall , and we just kind of hit it off from there . 

<root> It 's true . 

<root> Who else is involved in this project ? 

<root> Currently , we 're in talks with people . 

<root> There 's Jeff [ Drake ] , who is behind the camera . 

<root> Right now , yeah , he 's helping us right now . 

<root> We 're talking about doing some individual web series , video series . 

<root> Josh Kindig , he 's coming on board , he has some ideas for that too , he wants to take over " aywv " and do more gaming news . 

<root> There 's of course Jason , who is our editor and he 's the one who writes dD . 

<root> Digital Domain 

<root> What is your purpose behind this venture ? 

<root> Well , back in college , back in Collins College , Isabel and I , we had met like she said at Sandia View Academy , and we went off to college together in Arizona ; 

<root> and ... ( how do I best explain this ? ) 

<root> Basically , she came up with a few class projects , and I came up with a few class projects ; 

<root> we started working with a few of our friends , and colleagues and whatnot . 

<root> Those included Drew Cass , Devin Thurlow , people like that . 

<root> She had several ideas , and she used to draw a lot in the sketchbook , she used to have this thick sketchbook that she used to carry around with her everywhere , where she 'd draw these different characters and whatnot ; 

<root> and she was always really shy to show that off to people , and I wanted to help her show that stuff , and I wanted to bring it out to the world . 

<root> I was a writer , and she always liked my writings , so I was like , let 's just get both of our things together , and let 's get this done . 

<root> And for me , what I want the purpose to be , is to inspire people . 

<root> To bring a little more light to the world is what I want , out of all of this . 

<root> And what was the verse that we have ? 

<root> First Corinthians 9 : 25 ? 

<root> Yes . 

<root> Yeah , exactly . 

<root> We just want to be able to bring , like she said , bring light into the entertainment and into the media industry , specifically is what we do . 

<root> Yeah . 

<root> The future of the peace process in Israel 

<root> " The future is only peace . The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for . " 

<root> Shimon Peres image : David Shankbone . 

<root> Mr. President , as a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and as one of the fathers of the modern peace process in Israel , do you still think that there is a future to the peace process ? 

<root> The future is only peace . 

<root> The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for . 

<root> Why do I say peace ? 

<root> Because when you look historically , at the development of humanity , most of our lives we are living on the land . 

<root> The history is written with red ink . 

<root> The reason for it is because people were fighting for our land , either defending it or extending it , because that was the main source . 

<root> The land , the natural resources , the markets , all these go together . 

<root> The minute the land was replaced by science , what is there to fight about ? 

<root> Armies cannot conquer science . 

<root> Customs cannot check what a scientist has in his mind , they can see what he has in his pocket but not what he has in his mind so it ’s uncontrolled ; it means that borders are n’t important and distances are n’t important . 

<root> How do you approach the difficult challenge of talking to the Palestinians when , in the end , they do n’t want Israel to exist . 

<root> How do you come to an understanding to make peace possible ? 

<root> Well , what is the problem ? 

<root> I mean , is the problem national , say between Jews and Arabs ; or is it a matter of generations between an old age and a new age ? 

<root> You see , the terrorists are protesting against modernity . 

<root> They think that modernity may endanger their tradition . 

<root> They are simply afraid and hate modernity . 

<root> They consider modernity as their enemy , but then they have two problems . 

<root> First of all , can they exist on tradition ? 

<root> They cannot . 

<root> Sooner or later they will have to enter the new age . 

<root> All the talks about nationalities , etcetera , well , the new age has very little patience for history . 

<root> History is becoming more and more irrelevant . 

<root> How do you feel about that ? 

<root> Well , I distinguish between two histories , the spiritual and the material . 

<root> Or the history of events and the history of values . 

<root> The history of values is okay because wisdom is ageless ; it does n’t grow old , like material . 

<root> But events are totally unimportant for 2 reasons . 

<root> First , the event is unimportant . 

<root> Tell me , what events is today important such as how many elephants Hannibal had on the Alps , when you can have helicopters ? 

<root> Why should I bother my children with all this nonsense ? 

<root> What sort of a nose did Cleopatra have ? 

<root> God , I do n’t know ! 

<root> You can invite people to war over noses , but nobody will go to fight for noses any more . 

<root> On the other hand , there are already machines that can replace our memory . 

<root> Why should I bother my child with memory when he can buy a computer that will remember everything you asked him to remember ? 

<root> The waning importance of history 

<root> Is n’t the answer to that question that wise decisions are made with a basis from memory ? 

<root> Although a computer can have … 

<root> No , no . 

<root> Forget memory . 

<root> Look , the new age is unprecedented . 

<root> When something is unprecedented , it means it does n’t have a past , does n’t have a history . 

<root> It ’s totally oriented on the future . 

<root> And whoever dwells in the past , does n’t understand the future because the past is full of prejudices , of commitments . 

<root> It arrests us . 

<root> And then you say you wo n’t commit a mistake , so you ’ll commit new mistakes . 

<root> It does n’t matter . 

<root> `` I say brains is the greater producer of wealth , not oil . 

<root> It ’s limitless , and you ’ll see that the GNP of Israel is very close to the Saudis ’ . 

<root> So they are 3 times larger than us and they have all the oil in the world . 

<root> We have brains . " 

<root> — Peres , on whether the Arab states ' oil wealth will eclipse Israel 's prominence in the region . 

<root> What about the adage , “ Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it ” ? 

<root> So they will make new mistakes . 

<root> Mistake is inevitable as long as there are human beings . 

<root> But you cannot repeat mistakes because the world is not built on repetition ; it ’s built on mutation . 

<root> Do n’t you think Darfur is repetition ? 

<root> I think Darfur is , again , the last , or among the last battles between old and new . 

<root> What are they fighting for ? 

<root> What are they killing killing killing over ? 

<root> They do n’t carry futures . 

<root> It ’s not a mistake . 

<root> It belongs to a past . 

<root> It does n’t have a moment . 

<root> I am sure that the reasons for war are over , even though still there are wars which are an inertia from the past , a continuation that does n’t make sense . 

<root> I ’m answering your question . 

<root> The problem is how to enable the whole world to enter the new future , including the Arabs . 

<root> And there are already Arabs who did it . 

<root> Look at Turkey , who is knocking on the doors of the united Europe . 

<root> Why ? 

<root> It ’s not a geographic endeavor , it is an intellectual endeavor . 

<root> They say you can be Muslim and modern . 

<root> Scientology defector arrested after attempting to leave organization 

<root> Saturday , October 9 , 2010 

<root> Recent reports have revealed that a defector from the elite group within Scientology called the Sea Org was first persuaded to travel back to a management building for the organization in California , where he was interrogated by an attorney for Scientology and then arrested . 

<root> Daniel Montalvo in September 2010 , after having left the elite group within Scientology called the Sea Org . 

<root> Montalvo is holding a copy of the book Blown for Good critical of Scientology , written by Marc Headley . 

<root> Image : Mark Rathbun . 

<root> Daniel Montalvo , 19 , a member of Scientology all his life , was arrested after leaving its elite group the Sea Org . 

<root> He was released on US$ 20,000 bail on Thursday . 

<root> Montalvo was charged with taking hard drives and a zip drive from the Scientology organization after leaving the Sea Org group . 

<root> The Sea Org requires members to sign a billion-year-contract , agreeing to work for the organization founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard for multiple lifetimes . 

<root> Members of the Sea Org live a strict lifestyle – with little income , small diet provided and significant time invested in work per day . 

<root> Montalvo had read an article in the Scientology propaganda publication Freedom Magazine , which attacked high-ranking defectors from the organization including Tom Devocht and Mark Rathbun . 

<root> Montalvo had known Devocht personally , and came to the conclusion that the claims made about him in the Freedom article were lies . 

<root> Montalvo was subsequently motivated to seek out information about Scientology on the Internet , and came upon a blog written by Rathbun . 

<root> Montalvo contacted former members of Scientology , who helped him leave the organization and get in touch with Devocht . 

<root> He traveled to Florida to meet with Devocht , who had told Montalvo he would assist him with future employment and housing . 

<root> According to Rathbun the Scientology property in question was returned by mail to the organization by Montalvo shortly after he left the Sea Org . 

<root> Scientology officials have stated they have not received the materials . 

<root> After calling the Scientology organization by phone to attempt to speak with his mother , Montalvo was instead put through to a Scientology attorney , Kendrick Moxon . 

<root> Rathbun wrote , " Moxon proceeded to lie to Daniel that the hard drives were never returned , and made a convincing case ( not difficult to do with a 19 year old who does not even know the three branches of government ) that Daniel would be put behind iron bars for a good long time , UNLESS of course , he returned and cooperated with Moxon and routed out properly . " 

<root> To " route out " in Scientology jargon refers to the member who wishes to leave proceeding through a set of interrogative exit interviews while attached to the Scientology device called the E-meter . 

<root> According to Rathbun , a detective for the Los Angeles Sheriff 's office was provided with material from Scientology to build a case against Montalvo . 

<root> Rathbun stated , 

<root> " Daniel was picked up by an investigator in a black car with blacked out windows . 

<root> Instead of being taken to a hotel , where he could route out as promised , he was taken to the Century City Towers . 

<root> He was deposited in an office on the 33rd floor where a pricy church lawyer interrogated him for two hours . " 

<root> Rathbun asserted that Scientology officials , " ... plied the Sheriff 's detective with a grand conspiracy theory , characterizing me as the ' anti-christ ' of the church of Scientology . ... The next thing Daniel knows he 's in a cell where he sat for the next 30 hours . " 

<root> Steve Whitmore , a representative for the LA Sheriff 's office , told LA Weekly in a statement that the case involving Montalvo was being dealt with as charges relating to grand theft . 

<root> Whitmore stated Montalvo left Scientology-related employment in Los Angeles on September 24 . 

<root> On September 29 , Scientology officials went to the East Los Angeles sheriff 's station where they claimed Montalvo allegedly left the organization with computer hard drives . 

<root> Whitmore told LA Weekly that on October 6 after traveling back from Florida , Montalvo " walked into lobby of the East L.A. station and turned himself in " , and told the police , " everything he did " . 

<root> Whitmore stated to LA Weekly that the alleged crime involved five hard drives each of $ 200 in value . 

<root> Montalvo has been assisted by former members of Scientology , including musician Tiziano Lugli and actor Jason Beghe . 

<root> Rathbun requested donations via a statement made on his blog , in order to help Montalvo with his legal defense financing . 

<root> He described Montalvo as an individual , " facing the penitentiary in thanks for the following sins : a) Leaving a lifehood of slavery to get a taste of freedom and the world . b) Refusing - despite every provocation and incentive and threat - to frame three guys who went out of their ways ( and dipped into their pockets ) to help the kid achieve that freedom . " 

<root> Parents prosecuted after homeopathic treatment leads to daughter 's death 

<root> Friday , May 8 , 2009 

<root> Thomas Sam , 42 , and his wife Manju Sam , 36 , from Sydney , Australia , are undergoing trial for manslaughter by gross negligence for the death of their nine-month-old child , Gloria . 

<root> She died from infection caused by severe eczema after they shunned effective conventional medical treatments for homeopathy , a form of alternative medicine that has been described as pseudoscience . 

<root> Articles in peer-reviewed academic journals including Social Science & Medicine have characterized homeopathy as a form of quackery . 

<root> An example of severe eczema . 

<root> Image : Jambula . 

<root> Gloria developed severe eczema at the age of four months and the parents were advised to send the child to a skin specialist . 

<root> Thomas Sam , a practising homeopath , instead decided to treat his daughter himself . 

<root> His daughter 's condition deteriorated , to the point that the baby spent all her energy battling the infections caused by the constant breaking of the skin , leading to severe malnutrition and , eventually , her death . 

<root> By the end , Gloria 's eczema was so severe that her skin broke every time her parents changed her clothes or nappy , and in the words of the Crown prosecutor , Mark Tedeschi , QC , " Gloria spent a lot of the last five months of her life crying , irritable , scratching and the only thing that gave her solace was to suck on her mother 's breast . " 

<root> Gloria also became unable to move her legs . 

<root> Mr. Tedeschi also told the court that , over the last five months of her life , " Gloria 's eczema played a devastating role in her overall health and it is asserted by the Crown that both her parents knew this and discussed it with each other . " 

<root> However , despite their child 's severe illness , and her lack of improvement , the Sams continued to shun conventional medical treatment , instead seeking help from other homeopaths and naturopaths . 

<root> Gloria temporarily improved during the rare times they used conventional treatments , but they soon dropped them in favour of homeopathy , and she consistently worsened . 

<root> Allegedly , Thomas ' sister pleaded with him to send Gloria to a conventional medical doctor , but he replied " I am not able to do that " . 

<root> The parents are also accused of putting their social life ahead of their child , taking her on a trip to India and leaving her to servants while embarking on a busy social schedule , and giving her homeopathic drops instead of using the prescription creams they had been given . 

<root> Gloria was finally taken to the emergency department shortly before her death . 

<root> By this time , " her skin was weeping , her body malnourished and her corneas melting " , according to the Sydney Morning Herald . 

<root> Speaking in the parents ' defense , Tom Molomby , SC , said that , as the parents came from India , where homeopathy is in common use , they should be declared not guilty due to cultural differences . 

<root> Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that , if given to a healthy person undiluted , would cause symptoms similar to the disease . 

<root> Typical treatments take the dilutions , with ritualised shaking between each step of the dilution , past the level where any molecules of the original substance are likely to remain ; for homeopathic treatments to work , basic well-understood concepts in chemistry and physics would have to be wrong . 

<root> There is no evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebo for any condition . 

<root> Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency 

<root> Thursday , February 23 , 2006 

<root> Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient , researchers say . 

<root> A new study documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation . 

<root> The report 's authors say iodine deficiency is " the sleeper health issue in Australia " , and potentially a very serious one . 

<root> The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week , revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient . 

<root> The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised . 

<root> They say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders . 

<root> A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren - aged 8 – 10 years , from 88 schools - was carried out in New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia and Queensland , between July 2003 and December 2004 . 

<root> Tasmania was excluded from the study - where an voluntary iodine fortification program using iodised salt in bread , is ongoing . 

<root> The authors say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population . 

<root> They call for " urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia . " 

<root> Most iodine in food comes from seafood , milk and iodised salt . 

<root> Professor Cres Eastman , Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study , and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders , says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine . 

<root> Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems including brain damage , stunted growth and deafness . 

<root> Professor Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries . 

<root> " I suspect they wo n't do that on a voluntary basis , we 've tried so far and have n't succeeded , so we 've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand | that all salt should be iodised , " he said . 

<root> The report says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry , where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers . 

<root> Iodine released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades , but is now declining . 

<root> Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods . 

<root> The report states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods . 

<root> Professor Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised . 

<root> He says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt . 

<root> " The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs . 

<root> So if we go to the pregnant woman , she does n't get enough iodine , she wo n't make enough thyroid hormone , and the foetus wo n't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain , so you 'll then see consequences being loss of IQ , learning difficulties , hearing difficulties and other neurological problems , " Professor Eastman said . 

<root> " If an infant 's not getting enough iodine ... brain development wo n't be completed and they wo n't grow normally , and as you get older the problem will be that you will develop a goiter and your thyroid wo n't function as well as it should , so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life . " 

<root> More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency , and yet the problem is easily fixed . 

<root> The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt . 

<root> The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism , a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life . 

<root> WHO say Iodine deficiency is the world ’s most prevalent , yet easily preventable , cause of brain damage . 

<root> Professor Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found . 

<root> " Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis . 

<root> So that alarms me , because there 's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country , " he said . 

<root> " If Iodine deficiency is serious you lose 15 IQ points , on average . 

<root> There should n't be anyone suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia . " 

<root> Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand , says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year . 

<root> She says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right . 

<root> We need to " make sure there 's sufficient iodine added into the food supply , to help those people with a deficiency . 

<root> But at the other end of the scale we 've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people do n't get too much and get overdose , " Ms Bauchtman said . 

<root> " One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because people are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking . " 

<root> Senior researcher Mu Li , of the University of NSW 's school of public health , said " it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient , putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency . " 

<root> Athens ( Greek : Αθήνα , Athína ) , is the capital city of Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants . 

<root> It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece , and therefore of Western civilization . 

<root> Understand 

<root> Old Athens 

<root> The first pre-historic settlements was constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis . 

<root> The legend says that the King of Athens , Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom ( c. 1230 BC ) . 

<root> This process of synoikismos – bringing together in one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland , but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility . 

<root> By the 7th century BC , social unrest had become widespread , and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code ( hence " draconian " ) . 

<root> When this failed , they appointed Solon , with a mandate to create a new constitution ( 594 ) . 

<root> This was the great beginning of a new social revolution , which was the result of the democracy under Clisthenes ( 508 BC ) . 

<root> During the Middle Ages , Athens experienced a decline , but re-emerged under Byzantian rule . 

<root> Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades , actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period . 

<root> However , this fruitful period was short-lived , as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire , only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece . 

<root> Modern Olympic Games 

<root> Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games . 

<root> While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper - in various locations throughout Attica - the entire urban area of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike . 

<root> Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics ( from new freeways to light rail systems ) , the city 's historic center underwent serious renovation . 

<root> Most notable among the city 's facelift projects are the Unification of Archaeological Sites - which connects the city 's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical Thissio and Pláka districts . 

<root> The ancient Olympic Games took place in Olympia from 776 BCE to 394 AD . 

<root> It is a lengthy day trip from Athens to visit Olympia , but quite interesting . 

<root> Architecture 

<root> Athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State . 

<root> Although it had a prestigious past , the city 's political , economic , and cultural importance had declined over the centuries , leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times . 

<root> With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens , architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins , with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings , large city squares , green spaces , and wide avenues , making a conscious , decisive turn from the city 's Ottoman past . 

<root> The city regained its importance in Greek civilization , and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city , with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation 's past . 

<root> The 20th century however , marked the rapid development of Athens . 

<root> The city suffered minor damage during WWII , and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed , as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized . 

<root> In the 1960s and 1970s , many 19th century neoclassical buildings , often small and private , were demolished to make way for office buildings , often designed by great Greek architects . 

<root> The city also expanded outward through rash development , particularly towards the west , as its population grew by absorbing job-seekers from the provinces . 

<root> With the onset of the automobile , public officials reduced the city 's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s . 

<root> By the late 1980s and early 1990s , the city 's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and , coupled with the country 's new found remarkable prosperity , large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades . 

<root> Over the course of the next 15 years , money was poured into new transportation infrastructure projects , the restoration of surviving neoclassical buildings , the gentrification of the city 's historical center and the renovation of many former industrial areas and the city 's coastline . 

<root> The restoration of charming neoclassical buildings in the city 's historical center has been accompanied by the construction of attractive post-modern buildings in newer districts ; both of which have begun to improve the aesthetic essence of the city . 

<root> Athens today is ever evolving , forging a brand new identity for the 21st century . 

<root> Climate 

<root> Spring and late autumn are the best times to visit Athens . 

<root> Summer can be extremely hot and dry during heatwaves , but this rarely happens . 

<root> Winter is definitely low season , with the occasional rainy or snowy day , but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists . 

<root> Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads , on most sunny days the skies are azure blue . 

<root> The main reason attributed for the pollution of Athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave . 

<root> The government 's ban on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin . 

<root> Coron 

<root> Coron is in the province of Palawan , Philippines on Busuanga Island . 

<root> It is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations . 

<root> Background 

<root> Coron is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga , and the name of a different , smaller island just offshore . 

<root> The area is famous for its World War II wreck diving , and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world . 

<root> In September 1944 , a fleet of Japanese ships hiding in the harbor were sunk in a daring raid by the US navy . 

<root> The result is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef . 

<root> There are also attractions on Coron Island itself . 

<root> There are many beautiful white sand beaches , mostly tiny and surrounded by large limestone cliffs and wildlife . 

<root> Barracuda and Kayangan lakes are both stunning locations , and good for snorkeling , and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night . 

<root> History 

<root> The first inhabitants of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago . 

<root> They were a nomadic , seafaring people , living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture . 

<root> Although they are now sedentary ( with the young using cell phones , etc. ) , they maintain many of their old customs , traditions and beliefs . 

<root> Today , the Tagbanuas remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron . 

<root> In 1902 that Coron was registered as a town and the name of the town was officially changed from Penon de Coron to Coron . 

<root> From 1939 to the outbreak of World War II , the municipality experienced the mining boom . 

<root> Labor shifted from farming to mining . 

<root> In July 1942 the Japanese occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines . 

<root> On September 24 , 1944 , a group of Japanese ships were sunk by American warplanes in Coron waters as the ships retreated from Manila Bay . 

<root> To this day , about 10 or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world .

<root> How to Tell a Joke 

<root> Two Parts : 

<root> Getting the Material Right 

<root> Getting the Delivery Right 

<root> From one-liners to classic three-liners to the one-minute gag you tell your friends , a good joke pleases everyone . 

<root> Joke-telling is one of the best ways to ease tension , make a new friend , or light up a room . 

<root> That is , of course , if you can get a laugh . 

<root> Telling good jokes is an art that comes naturally to some people , but for others it takes practice and hard work . 

<root> Part 1 of 2 : 

<root> Getting the Material Right 

<root> Know your audience . 

<root> All aspects of the joke you tell , from the content to the length , need to be suited to your audience . 

<root> What ’s funny to a group of 20-year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70-year old - uncle laugh ( then again , maybe not ) . 

<root> Everyone ’s an individual , so there are no hard and fast rules . 

<root> But , unless you personally know the members of your audience , here are some good rules of thumb to follow : 

<root> elderly people wo n’t like crude jokes ; 

<root> stay away from misogynist jokes if you ’ve got an audience full of women ; 

<root> people of a specific ethnic or racial group wo n’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group ; 

<root> and jokes requiring specialized knowledge ( of , for example , science or old movies ) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge . 

<root> The more you know about your audience the better you ’ll be able to tailor your jokes to them . 

<root> Choose great material . 

<root> You can find fodder lots of places — from your life , joke files online , by repurposing jokes you ’ve heard in the past , and so on . 

<root> You may want to start your own joke file . 

<root> You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer . [ 1 ] 

<root> The latter option may allow for easier revision . 

<root> Decide on a target . 

<root> Every joke has a “ target , ” which is what the joke is about . 

<root> It ’s important that the joke ’s target ( the most basic element of your material ) be suited to your audience . 

<root> Make sure it ’s a target your audience will be interested in and something they ’re likely willing to laugh at . [ 2 ] 

<root> For example , husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa ; 

<root> students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous . 

<root> Have a realistic but exaggerated setup . 

<root> The opening of the joke — or setup — should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it , but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge . [ 3 ] 

<root> Think of the setup as the foundation of a story . 

<root> It ’s a fundamental part of the joke ; 

<root> if you do n’t lay a good foundation here , then the punchline wo n’t make sense to the audience or they wo n’t find it humorous . 

<root> Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny — 

<root> it ’s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny . [ 4 ] 

<root> The exaggeration can be slight or considerable — 

<root> it just depends on the individual joke . 

<root> Surprise with the punchline . 

<root> The ending of the joke is obviously crucial . 

<root> This is where the payoff comes in , what makes the joke succeed or fail . 

<root> If you want to make the audience laugh , your punchline needs to be surprising . 

<root> Some jokes also have what is called a tag or topper , which is an additional punchline . 

<root> The tag builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way . 

<root> Make the joke your own . 

<root> Lots of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told . 

<root> For your joke to be funny , it has to surprise the audience in some way , which means it has to seem original or new . 

<root> One way to personalize a joke is to change the ending . [ 5 ] 

<root> Another option is to dress the joke up as a story about your own life . 

<root> This will make a familiar joke unrecognizable . 

<root> It may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s) . [ 6 ] 

<root> Know your material . 

<root> Practicing your joke is crucial . 

<root> You do n’t need to have it completely memorized — in fact , you " should n’t " memorize it — but you need to be really comfortable with it , so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked , which is very possible once you ’re in front of an audience . 

<root> Memorized jokes sound wooden , like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer . 

<root> Good jokes have a lot of details and personality , so do n’t be afraid to embellish . [ 7 ] 

<root> Try different things out and see what feels right , what sounds best . 

<root> Do n’t use a joke until you ’re completely comfortable with it . 

<root> Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself . 

<root> If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s , your joke isn ’t ready and you need to practice more . [ 8 ] 

<root> You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you ’re ready for a “ real ” audience . 

<root> How to Wash Overalls in a Washing Machine 

<root> Whether you are a working man or just a little cutie trying to stay cute , those overalls are going to need washing sooner or later . 

<root> The straps on adults ’ overalls often get so twisted during the wash that one wishes she had just used an old fashioned washboard instead . 

<root> Your appliances are also murder on the straps , which are almost always the first things to wear out on your overalls . 

<root> This article will show you how to save time and prevent wear , extending the life of your overalls until they are so soft you could wear them to bed . 

<root> Steps 

<root> Wash alone or with " like " clothing . 

<root> It ’s best to wash adults ’ overalls alone , especially men ’s . 

<root> However , it is okay to wash just a few items with them , like blue jeans . 

<root> What you do n’t want to wash with them is anything that can get twisted up with the straps , like women ’s long sleeve shirts or kids ’ blankets . 

<root> Think similar clothing , minus the twisty-ness . 

<root> Just do the denim and canvas stuff together . 

<root> Fasten the straps to the bib . 

<root> If you did n’t know already , the bib is the top front part with the breast pockets . 

<root> Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash . 

<root> This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash . 

<root> Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened . 

<root> This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run . 

<root> Do n’t skip it . 

<root> Take the 20 seconds to use a couple twist ties on the fasteners to make sure they do n’t come loose . 

<root> If your washing machine is worth its salt , it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it . 

<root> All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience . 

<root> Empty the pockets . 

<root> Overalls have more pockets than pants . 

<root> The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket . 

<root> Kids put rocks , candy , and bugs in these . 

<root> Men put cell phones and small tools in them . 

<root> Women defy the laws of purse-space , so when it comes to bib pockets , the sky is the limit . 

<root> Make sure all the pockets are empty . 

<root> Move the strap adjusters around . 

<root> You ’ve probably got them just the way you like them , but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally , the straps will last longer . 

<root> Depending on the adjusters , you may be able to leave them a little loose too . 

<root> The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles ( not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes ) . 

<root> Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing . 

<root> This is the same idea as rotating tires . 

<root> You know about rotating your tires , do n't you ? 

<root> Tips 

<root> If you wash your overalls alone or in a light load , use about half the detergent called for and less water . 

<root> Leave the straps fastened and twist-tied to the bib when you throw them in the dryer . 

<root> This will cut down on some of the racket , but you 're still going to hear them . 

<root> Warnings 

<root> The paper-type twist ties will deteriorate a little , but the dryer filter screen will catch the fallout . 

<root> Plastic-type twist ties will hold up in the wash , but may or may not melt in your dryer . 

<root> Use with caution . 

<root> How to Make Skittles Vodka 

<root> Three Methods : Single Serving ( 25 mL Shot ) 

<root> Bottles of " Skittled " 

<root> Vodka Dishwasher Bottle Method 

<root> Making Skittles vodka is a fun way to add a splash of fruity flavor and color to regular vodka . 

<root> All you need to do is place your favorite combination of Skittles candies into a glass or bottle of vodka and wait for it to infuse . 

<root> You can then use your Skittles vodka to make brightly-colored cocktails or even serve it as a sugary shot ! 

<root> Find multiple methods for making Skittles vodka after the jump -- and soon you 'll be tasting the rainbow ! 

<root> Ingredients 

<root> A handle ( 1.75 liters , about a half gallon ) of vodka per bag of Skittles 

<root> A large bag of Skittles candy ( the " movie size " bag ) 

<root> Method 1 of 3 : Single Serving ( 25 mL Shot ) 

<root> Separate the colors of Skittles that you want to flavor the vodka with . 

<root> Many people choose to leave out the green , which is lime if you 're using original Skittles , and purple , which is grape in the original style , as they can create a weird taste combination or a less than appealing color for the final product . 

<root> However , you can put them in if you want . 

<root> If you do n't mind mixed flavors , you can just skip this step altogether . 

<root> Add six Skittles to 25 ml of vodka . 

<root> Keep swirling the mixture until the Skittles are almost completely dissolved . 

<root> Note that the ratio of Skittles to vodka varies from recipe to recipe . 

<root> You should experiment to find your preferred mix before making larger bottles . 

<root> Filter out the remaining Skittle " insides " . 

<root> With single servings like this , you can decide which flavor(s) you like best and proceed to making bottles , if you desire . 

<root> Method 2 of 3 : Bottles of " Skittled " Vodka 

<root> Pour out some vodka from a bottle to make room for Skittles . 

<root> Separate the Skittles by color . 

<root> Add the Skittles ( 20 - 25 per 350 ml / 11.8 fl oz ) . 

<root> Let the mixture sit for a day or two . 

<root> Shake occasionally so the flavour mixes well . 

<root> Strain out the Skittles using a filter , such as a paper coffee filter or a clean t-shirt . 

<root> Refrigerate overnight . 

<root> Method 3 of 3 : Dishwasher Bottle Method 

<root> Separate the colors from five bags of 200 g Skittles . 

<root> Using 5 x 700 ml / 23.6 fl oz bottles , pour 300 ml / 10.1 fl oz of vodka into a jug and fill each bottle with skittles . 

<root> Place the bottles in your dishwasher and put on an intensive cycle . 

<root> One third of of the way through the cycle , shake all bottles vigorously . 

<root> Two thirds of the way through the cycle , shake all bottles vigorously . 

<root> Once the cycle has finished , shake all bottles vigorously again . 

<root> Then place in the freezer for 2 hours . 

<root> Once the vodka is cold , it should be syrupy . 

<root> Take a sieve , line it with a piece of cheesecloth ( muslin ) or a coffee filter , place above a large jug and pour the vodka through slowly . 

<root> Once the first bottle has been filtered , wash out the bottle and pour the Skittles vodka back in . 

<root> Repeat the above two steps for all bottles , ensuring that everything is cleaned between uses to prevent color contamination . 

<root> Place all of the bottles in the freezer until you are ready to drink . 

<root> Do n't worry , the vodka wo n't freeze . 

<root> You are finished . 

<root> Enjoy your tasty creation . 

<root> Tips . 

<root> If you want to make it more quickly , cut the skittles in half before putting them into vodka . 

<root> Shake every 15 minutes . 

<root> They 'll dissolve in an hour instead of a day . 

<root> Or you could just scoop them out when the color dissolves . 

<root> Start with small amount of vodka and Skittles at first to experiment which combination of taste suits you best . 

<root> You can carry this out with larger amount of vodka and Skittles once you have decided that you enjoy the taste . 

<root> The lime green Skittles add a sourness to the drink , so if you want one that 's sweet , leave the green ones out and add them to their own bottle for a sour lime vodka . 

<root> Another approach is to buy five bottles of vodka and five bags of Skittles . 

<root> Then separate the candy and use one flavor for each bottle . 

<root> ( Or get four bottles and an empty , to allow room for the skittles . ) 

<root> If using a t-shirt to strain , be sure fabric softener or a dryer sheet had not been used with it , lets you get some extra ( unwanted ) flavoring ( and potentially toxic chemicals ) . 

<root> Warnings 

<root> Drink responsibly . 

<root> Never drink and drive . 

<root> Know your limits , and do not drink to the extent of intoxication . 

<root> Do not drink if underage in your country . 

<root> Things You 'll Need 

<root> Each handle of vodka ( 1.75 liters , about a half gallon ) requires a large bag worth of Skittles , so if you plan on doing only one flavor for a flavorful vodka , you 'll have to buy 5 large bags of Skittles . 

<root> Coffee filter , cheesecloth / muslin , or an extremely clean T-shirt 

<root> Large funnel or strainer to hold filter
