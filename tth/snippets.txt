`p.
Clearly the two phrases are therefore semantically different; but notice also that the
semantic properties of the first phrase are due explicitly to its internal structure.
The temporality implicatures could be expressed in a more `q.purely` semantic
fasion with a choice of wording, like `i.a procession of students complained`/.  This
would rely on the conventional meaning of `i.procession` (or `i.stream`/, `i.sequence`/,
etc.) to provide the expressive `q.time` dimension.  But the `i.student after student`
phraseology achieves this effect more economically and with more `q.oomph` because the
internal repetition in the phrase itself effectively models the recurrence it
seeks to feature semantically.  Here linguistic form actually does reproduce
factual structure, like a syntactic version of onomatopoeia.  This fact of internal structure
clearly can only be fully modeled by taking seriously the exact composition of the phrase, not
treating the phrase-structure as a convention fully subsumed by a semantic role.

In addition, aside from the expressive detail which depends on the actual phrase
structure (which therefore cannot be summarized away), this inner structure also
governs morphosyntactic possibilities over all.  `i.A procession of students`
captures a similar temporal progression but also fully absorbs `i.student` in a plural
guise, and `i.A procession of students complained about `qmark-dubious;his grade` is straightforwardly
ungrammatical.  In Langacker's `q.Three times` example, the inter-word
`q.linkage` captures the aforementioned complexities in a reasonably non-arbitrary
way, I believe.  `i.Student` is linked as subject-to-verb with `i.asked`/, and as
subject-to-object with `i.question`/.  It is true that these link-pairs seem to
violate agreement norms, but there is nothing in the Link Grammar paradigm %-- which
practices Dependency Grammar with a rather detailed and intricate
inventory of inter-word relations, or `q.links` %-- mandating that
`i.all` link-pairs exhibit forced agreement (like singular/plural).  Agreement, when it
applies, is a property `i.of` link pairs.  There is also an implicit
(cross-phrasal) link between `i.student` and `i.Three` %-- clarifying that, considered
in its entirely, the sentence is about three students precisely %-- and the presence of
this kind of link alters how the other links connecting to the word `i.student` are
assessed.  In particular, this latter link stipulates that the word `i.student` is being
simultaneously understood in both a plural and a singular sense, so it permits
singular `i.and` plural link forms which, more commonly, could only be
singular `i.or` plural.  So link grammar can offer an elegant analysis of
singular/plural `q.underdeterminism`/, expressed in the
same underlying graph-context terminology as most other link-grammar theorizing.
It would be unfair to use this as a case against Phrase Structure grammars without a
detailed presentation of how these grammars would handle such a case in turn, but
I'd argue that link grammar accommodates this complex example with relatively little
departure from its underlying theoretical and notational or presentational commitments.

  So `i.a student complained` focuses not
on the numeric count of one, but on a singular event (unlike
`q.`i.only one` student complained`/); `i.students complained` focuses not on the
plural measure of students involved, but on the fact that a certain type
of event happened several times.  `i.Many students complained`
focuses not on sheer number (unlike `i.a large number of students complained`/),
but rather on the implication that complaints were widespread enough to represent
a significant sample, perhaps a majority sentiment, among the student body.
The semantics of the former two forms seems to focus attention
on the `i.events` of complaining, while the `i.many students` construction seems
to focus more on their suggesting a prevailing attitude.  `i.Students complained`
appears to single out each event as distinct, even though there are several of
them; whereas `i.Many students complained` appears to construe the
events as each resembling the other, to the point where they partly
lose their individuality.  `q.Isolated events`/,
in the English idiom, are those which are atypical; as we cognitively
shift from the events as discrete to recurring patterns, they become
suggestive of a larger state of affairs.  By implication, if many students
complained, many other students may be unhappy; the extent of students'
unrest is no longer measurable by the multiplicity of the complaining-events.


Formal models of syntax and semantics often borrow notation from formal
language theory; for example, notations for Parts of Speech lifted
from functional programming languages.`footnote.
A note on notation: I adopt the Haskell convention (referring to the Haskell
programming language and other functional languages) of using arrows both between
parameters and before output notation, but for visual cue I add one dot above the
arrow in the former case, and two dots in the latter: `argsToReturn;.
I use `N; for the broadest designation of nouns (the broadest
noun type, assuming we are using type-theoretic principles),
with extra markings for more specific types (in principle
similar notation could be adopted for verbs, propositions, and so on).
