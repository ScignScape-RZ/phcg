A Few Words about Writing and Resistance}\end{center}}

{\pmpara}
I have written the poems that follow with tormented thoughts of Gaza. And if anyone asks why I, an American Jew, should have written so much about a place I have never been, my short answer is that I write about Gaza because I cannot write any other way. For me, to think of Gaza is to touch the drama of human resistance: not only resistance to oppression but resistance to the most insidious powers of intellectual and spiritual destruction, the lying and the sophistry that modern communication technology has honed to something almost ineffably sinister. In this respect all human beings are equally vulnerable. The dehumanizing of Gaza by way of propaganda has its counterpart in the deafening blandishments of modern media, replete with militarism and consumerism: both aim to corrupt the moral core of their hearers, and neither gives any quarter.
{\pmpara}
If language is the most distinctively human capability, it's easy to understand why the contamination of language must accompany the most inhuman actions of governments and their corporate masters. And the reverse holds true as well. With humanity under such fundamental threat, poetry, the most intense form of language, is itself an act of resistance --- in fact, it is a means of human survival, the ultimate index of freedom.

{\pmpara}
How well these poems live up to such standards is for others to decide. But I don't think anyone can question the urgency of the threats we face as human beings in a world of propaganda. And it seems obvious to me that there is, and must be, an indelible bond between each individual's battle to retain his or her humanity and the battle to secure a place like Gaza from the assaults that target every aspect of its people, from its children’s lives to the visibility of their faces on American television. If Israeli PR experts can get away with speaking as if nothing but \q{terrorists} existed in Gaza; if the Hillary Clintons of the world can get away with blaming Gaza's government for its death toll at the very moment Israeli shells are obliterating apartment buildings, mosques, schools, hospitals and U.N. shelters; if a Nobel Peace laureate like Elie Wiesel can get away with castigating Gazans for \q{child sacrifice} while an illegal occupying power kills hundreds of their little ones; then something irretrievable will have been lost.

{\pmpara}
What can we do to prevent it? That depends a good deal on who we are, and where we either have or can cultivate the kind of power that can bring justice. But as the great singer/songwriter and activist Phil Ochs said, during the Vietnam carnage, \q{in such an ugly time the true protest is beauty.} And true beauty, one might add, is protest.

\begin{stanza}
If I were to be born again,\verseline
it might be as the white moth\verseline
whose slow, flexing heartbeat\verseline
of wings
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
declares its pittance\verseline
in a vast anonymity of snow...
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
It might be as the spore\verseline
borne on mimosa tendrils\verseline
in an uncertain breeze,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
alone in a tiny pivot of air,\verseline
all the earth a mystery hovering below.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
For I am my place, and\verseline
I have nowhere to go,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
and all hearts are my heart,\verseline
and none knows me,\verseline
every breath shakes my world\verseline
though not a syllable is mine ---
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
not a glance my glance, yet in every one\verseline
I disappear behind its silence...
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
And where a petal drops onto the fixed eyes\verseline
of the child whose bracts are\verseline
already in earth,\verseline
whose face\verseline
is cold with death, her eyes
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
blue and blank\verseline
as the flower that was ---
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
where,\verseline
at dawn, a boy rises from another tear\verseline
to test the blue air\verseline
left behind by the bomb,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
and cannot find any path\verseline
to a door, or womb, or nightmare\verseline
clearer than smoke\verseline
or louder than a shroud,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
and not even the first word\verseline
of mourning can be said ---
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I also rise;
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
That is me.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Because I am not dead.\verseline
Because I am not there.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Because I cannot breathe\verseline
the air motionless forever\verseline
in the child's breast,
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
and cannot touch the sky\verseline
that is all that's left\verseline
to the last boy's famished eyes.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Because I wander that sky unseen,\verseline
never to touch their earth.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
And because,\verseline
whatever I touch,\verseline
it is their faces I will feel,\verseline
their silence my breath will trace.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
They've fixed the game,\verseline

But the dome shifts slowly overhead\verseline

What can you piss\verseline

\begin{stanza}
Damn it all, I've been seeing it in my dreams.\verseline
A little bit\verseline
of imagination, and there's a fetor all through me\verseline
that giggles, then screams...
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Atop the wall's gray brink\verseline
I've been longing to write\verseline
something fiercely ugly, wordless as a smell,\verseline
something that would gloat\verseline
there when I'm gone\verseline
like a slow death, with pulse\verseline
to match, bleeding all over the light.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
A stain impossible to dispel\verseline
that would stink\verseline
through the night...
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I reach into my pants\verseline
to see what can be done.\verseline
But a pimply-faced guard quickly raises his gun\verseline
and I lose my chance;\verseline
I gather he thought I meant something else.

\begin{stanza}
Summer has its clammy skin against my window.\verseline
Even here, at dawn you can smell death ---\verseline
yes, smell it in the silence of\verseline
the casual newspaper,\verseline
the purring of the first neighborhood\verseline
car, a moving gloom\verseline
rabid with secrets.\verseline
No one is saying anything.\verseline
But we all know of more dead children in Gaza,\verseline
people walk the three blocks to synagogue\verseline
to nag and natter about it,\verseline
if not to pray for the victims. Of course\verseline
we cannot hear the bombs ---\verseline
we only built them.\verseline
No, I'm hearing nothing new.\verseline
I've swallowed a stench of silence and cannot cough it up.\verseline
Awakening today, I could not at first remember\verseline
the reason of my dread. There's something maniacal\verseline
about an alarm that shrieks,\verseline
{\vrsindent}Begin, begin, begin!

I'm afraid to leave my room.\verseline
Am I thinking of the kids who risk a sniper's bullet\verseline
if they take a walk?\verseline
But this is New Jersey --- above me is a vague blue wall,\verseline
heat without sound, no shapes, no words. That's\verseline
what terrifies: reality going about its business\verseline
while its distant products turn fatal to it.\verseline
Silence poisons every calm.\verseline
This shirt sticks to my back's hair --- a penance?\verseline
I find myself tearing bits out of the newspaper\verseline
as if to patch with stalled time what demons have pierced;\verseline
at night the sweating sky purples with rage\verseline
and there is danger in the gimlet stars.

I'm lying, of course. I'm not afraid,\verseline
I'm only saying it to convince myself I am --- because\verseline

averted as they pass the word, row on silent row,\verseline

\begin{poem}


\begin{stanza}
I saw young men scramble from an earthen tunnel\verseline
bootless, unhelmeted, guns in their hands. They meant\verseline
to strike Israeli tanks attacking Gaza --- \& they were doomed\verseline
from the start, it was the army that had made the film\verseline
I watched (black \& white, with white\verseline
cross-hairs stenciled over the middle of the frame,\verseline
so we'd know\verseline
the invaders had those brave ones in their sights) ---\verseline
\& soon, sure enough, explosions\verseline
buffeted them, \& (when they tried\verseline
to retreat) destroyed their tunnel too.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
But I had time for three thoughts while the picture lasted.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
First: wonder at the freshness of their hearts --- \verseline
running (not marching, thank the Lord)\verseline
so eagerly into battle, not to die really, but to contend\verseline
proudly for their homes, their mothers \& their fate,\verseline
\& to sacrifice (just as proudly) if need be, but not to mourn.\verseline
Too often jaded by the joyless human carnival\verseline
of lies, cruelty \& folly, I caught my breath\verseline
at such hope, such carefree license with the gift of lives ---\verseline
my heart rose at their generosity, but not, alas, for long.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Next I knew deep sadness. I saw\verseline
that the young were lost, \& saw, what's more,\verseline
how such young loves were lost for nothing;\verseline
no child survived because of them, no prisoner escaped,\verseline
no one would visit their graves with thanks from the living.\verseline
Having hoped merely to scratch a scar or momentary\verseline
mark on the monster's tail, what could\verseline
they have done --- what could any creature have done ---\verseline
to atone for the wasting of such cherished life?\verseline
I chided my heart's pride in them then,\verseline
I scorned myself for having waved a handkerchief\verseline
with pointless tears to decorate a crime.
\end{stanza}




\begin{stanza}
Then anger came; it elbowed grief aside \&\verseline
stared me down. \cq{How dare you mourn?} it said,\verseline
\cq{\& reproach yourself with mourning?\verseline
Do you scorn the spurned\verseline
when he rises, just to be kicked again?\verseline
Do you blame the face that yields to blows\verseline
only because a man won't turn his back?\verseline
Is it for the hopeless to cast away freedom, too?\verseline
Did their hands dig the stony channels\verseline
that turned the current of their loves,\verseline
either to cowardice or to death?}
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Then I knew that I must rage, \& knew\verseline
the curse of silence, for I saw\verseline
I could not say what I felt.\verseline
Why must generosity run unheeded into death?\verseline
Why a tunnel, not a grateful eye, to draw such fruits \& sorrows in?\verseline
Why this squalid power over fragile youth?\verseline
Why such puny sunsets before\verseline
the immensity of night?
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
The picture faded, \& without a sound\verseline
those young men, buried \& unspeaking,\verseline
left me without words, bereft of time.

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipagestanza}
\textit{Occupied Palestine, March 2011}. Ehud \cq{Udi} Fogel was killed in his home in the West Bank settlement of Itamar, along with his wife and three young children, on the night of March 11, 2011.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
No other Israeli Jews were killed in occupied Palestine that year.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
Udi Fogel, an Orthodox rabbi, was a tank officer in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). During and after his service in Israel's military occupation, Fogel raised his family in Gaza, in the exclusively Jewish settlement of Netzarim. Until 2005, Netzarim was part of a bloc of Israeli colonies known as Gush Katif, which occupied much of Gaza's most valuable land and broke the 1.5 million Palestinians inhabiting Gaza into scattered enclaves.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
After Netzarim was closed by Israel, Fogel's religious convictions led him to the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the occupied West Bank. There he served as a teacher, under the supervision of a former chief rabbi of the IDF, telling students of the holy obligation of settling the West Bank.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
Hakim and Amjad Awad, 17 and 18 at the time of the killings, were both convicted in Israeli military courts and sentenced to multiple life terms. Virtually the only evidence against them consisted of their confessions, though both had initially denied involvement and members of their families stated that they had been elsewhere at the time of the attack. (Those family members were not asked to testify at the trial.) It is unclear how the youths' confessions were obtained.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
Hakim told the military judges that Israelis had tied up and killed two men from his village. \cq{This is what the state does to me every day,} he said. \cq{When I want to leave my village I have to undergo a search which always involves beatings.} The judges told him to refrain from discussing politics.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
Defense Attorney Raed Erda enraged the judges by pointing out that even Israel's Supreme Court had ruled that murders committed inside the territories are considered acts of war. To observers' disgust, he added, \cq{Houses are being built on their lands, there's no work, no education, the occupation is pushing people from all directions and a boy like the defendant goes out and does things like this without realizing their consequences.}
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
Jewish media expressed deep sympathy for Udi Fogel's father, who lamented that Palestinians enjoy favorable conditions in Israeli jails.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
\textit{Jewish Week} editor Gary Rosenblatt suggested that international media had refused to treat the Fogels' murder as their lead story because \cq{we expect Palestinians to act in inhuman ways in expressing their hatred of Jews.} Rosenblatt also blamed Israeli newspapers for treating the Fogels as \cq{second-class Jews} because they were \cq{religious.}
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
Rabbi Elyakim Levanon, a prominent clergyman among the Jewish settlers, told Udi's older brother that Udi's death was \cq{not private, it's public,} because the killing of his family would encourage Israel to build more settlements in occupied Palestine. A former Chief Rabbi of Israel eulogized the Fogels by comparing Palestinians to Nazis and promising: \cq{We will not bend, we will not give up...and nothing will prevent our faith in the righteousness of our path.}
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
The military prosecutor called on the judges to disregard the youth of the boys convicted of the killings. They \cq{acted on a malicious and satanic ideology,} he said.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
Surviving members of the Fogel family, including a 12-year-old daughter, have pledged to \cq{be strong} and to continue expanding Israel's occupation of Palestinian land.
\end{minipagestanza}

\begin{minipagestanza}
In 2014, Israel's activities in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and East Jerusalem resulted in the deaths of 2,314 Palestinians and 17,125 injuries, compared with 39 deaths and 3,964 injuries in 2013, according to the annual report by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

\begin{stanza}
If I try to understand a dead man I never knew\verseline
from the relative safety of ignorance, it is to stress\verseline
the contradictions I will never be able to resolve.\verseline
First: I know I cannot share the origins\verseline
by which a boy was born, a boy learned the alphabet\verseline
of clothes, roles, manners, a Jew's youth,\verseline
nor the sickening plunge of that youth's last lesson ---\verseline
that rabbis rape, that saviors turn away.\verseline
But I'm just as shy with the boy at twenty-one,\verseline
helmeted, camouflaged, fatigued, carrying\verseline
the scar on his heart and a six-pointed medallion\verseline
around his neck, lying across the sand, like a lover,\verseline
near Gaza behind a swiveled gun.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
The face is young and blank in the only photo I've seen.\verseline
Perhaps the boy dreamed of lining up\verseline
his tormentors in that olive-drab gunsight;\verseline
maybe he saw old lechers, not panicking women and their\verseline
sons, when his brigade's guns were torching houses with\verseline
{\vrsindent}\cq{repeated shelling} as the victims fled...\verseline
maybe he believed his colonel when that maniac\verseline
{\vrsindent}pronounced Palestinians the enemies of God.\verseline
Or, maybe he was maddened with the mumbling myth\verseline
{\vrsindent}of soldiers who believe themselves invincible,\verseline
though of course he wasn't --- no more than the \cq{six men}\verseline
his unit killed in a \cq{summary execution} in Khuza'a\verseline
{\vrsindent}one August day, nor the hundred or more helpless who fell\verseline
to his brigade's artillery in Rafah.\verseline
But how much, then, did the young sufferer see?\verseline
Could there have been guilt, as his fire raged out in agony?
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
Or did his binoculars reveal a frightened boy\verseline
who offered only terror against the ugly threat\verseline
{\vrsindent}(a barrel shaft upright, burning to invade\verseline
{\vrsindent} a child, impale his innocence)...\verseline
Did he hear his own voice in the collective cry of pain?\verseline
I hardly dare conceive how conscience,\verseline
seeping over the scene, might have enlarged the stain:\verseline
\cq{You did well, for larger men than you have doomed the young ---\verseline
though once the victim, you are among the strong.}\verseline
{\vrsindent}(Some who were his friends now carried suspect memories\verseline
{\vrsindent}and had to go.) Or, heard in a whisper, a taunt in his ear,\verseline
\cq{Have no pride. What men did to you, you've done.}\verseline
{\vrsindent}(And would do again, for no slogan could shatter\verseline
that circle of guilt.)\verseline
Or perhaps the voice framed the eeriest, most sinister words of all:\verseline
\cq{Nothing matters, all is death, and in death there is no difference\verseline
between the bullet and the brain, beaten and betrayer, all are one.\verseline
Forget good and evil, leave life, know only what is gone.}
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
I do not know. But he is gone,\verseline
gone beyond mourning. Self-victimed now,\verseline
dumb to accuse, dumb to suffer, he cannot throw\verseline
this taint from his breast. And if I labor to peel\verseline
the web of violence from the wounded rest, it is to show\verseline
how numb is my heart, that cannot learn to feel\verseline
remorse enough for the brute he was, and was not;\verseline
for the bloody deed he suffered, and did;\verseline
for the innocence he ravaged and the terror he bequeathed\verseline
when the deluge that drowned all good and all bad\verseline
