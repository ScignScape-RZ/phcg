`spsubsectiontwoline.Interpretive Processes and Triggers`
`p.
The type-theory/procedural perspective I will mostly work from
here contrasts with and adds nuance to
a more `q.logical` or `q.truth-theoretic` paradigm which
tends to interpret semantic phenomena via formal logic %--
for example, singular/plural in Natural Language
as a basically straightforward translation of the
individual/set distinction in formal logic.  Such
formal intuitions are limited in the sense that (to
continue this example) the conceptual mapping from
single to plural can reflect a wide range of
residual details beyond just quantity and multitudes.
Compare `i.I sampled some chocolates` (where the count-plural
suggests `i.pieces` of chocolate) and
`i.I sampled some coffees` (where the count-plural implies
distinguishing coffees by virtue of grind, roast, and other
differences in preparation) (note that both are contrasted
to mass-plural forms like `i.I sampled some coffee` where
plural agreement points toward material continuity; there
is no discrete unit of coffee qua liquid).  Or compare
`i.People love rescued dogs` with `i.People fed the rescued dogs`
%-- the second, but not the first, points toward
an interpretation that certain `i.specific` people
fed the dogs (and they did so `i.before` the dogs
were rescued).
`p`

`p.
The assumption that logical modeling can capture all the
pertinent facets of Natural-Language meaning can
lead us to miss the amount of situational reasoning
requisite for commonplace understanding.  In
`i.People fed the rescued dogs` there is an exception to the
usual pattern of how tense and adjectival modification
interact: in `i.He has dated several divorced millionaires`
it is implied that the ladies or gentlemen in question
were divorced and millionaires `i.when` he dated them: that the
events which gave them these properties occurred `i.before`
the time frame implied (by tense) as the time of reference
for the states of affairs discussed in the sentence
(jokes or rhetorical flourishes can toy with these expectations,
but that's why they `i.are`/, say, jokes). But we read `q.people fed` in
`i.People fed the rescued dogs` as occurring before the rescue;
because we assume that `i.after` being rescued the dogs would be
fed by veterinarians and other professionals (who would
probably not be designated with the generic `q.people`/), and
also we assume the feeding helped the dogs survive.  We also
hear the verb as describing a recurring event; compare
with `i.I fed the dog a cheeseburger`/.
`p`


`p.
To be sure, there are patterns and templates governing
scope/quantity/tense interactions that help us build logical models
of situations described in language.  Thus
`i.I fed the dogs a cheeseburger` can be read such that there
are multiple cheeseburgers %-- each dog gets one %--
notwithstanding the singular form on `i.a cheeseburger`/:
the plural `i.dogs` creates a scope that can elevate
the singular `i.cheeseburger` to an implied plural;
the discourse creates multiple reference frames each
with one cheeseburger.  Likewise the morphosyntax is
quite correct in: `i.All the rescued dogs are taken to an
experienced vet; in fact, they all came from the same
veterinary college` %-- the singular on `i.vet` is properly
alligned with the plural `i.they` because of the scope-binding
(from a syntactic perspective) and space-building
(from a semantic perspective) effects of the `q.dogs` plural.
Or, in the case of `i.I fed the dog a cheeseburger every day`
there is an implicit plural because `q.every day` builds
multiple spaces: we can refer via the spaces collectively
using a plural (`i.I fed the dog a cheeseburger every day %--
I made them at home with vegan cheese`/) or refer within
one space more narrowly, switching to the singular
(`i.Except Tuesday, when it was a turkey burger`/).
`p`

`p.
Layers of scope, tense, and adjectives interact in complex ways that
leave room for common ambiguities: `i.All the rescued dogs are [/were]
taken to an experienced [/specialist] vet` is consistent with a reading
wherein there is exactly one vet, and she has or had treated every dog.
It is `i.also` consistent with a reading where there
are multiple vets and each dog is or was treated
by one or another.  Resolving such ambiguities
tends to call for situational reasoning and a `q.feel` for situations,
rather than brute-force logic.  If a large dog shelter describes
their operational procedures over many years, we might assume
there are multiple vets they work or worked with.  If instead the
conversation centers on one specific rescue we would be
inclined to imagine just one veterinarian.  Lexical and tense
variation also guides these impressions: the past-tense
form (`i....the rescued dogs were taken...`/) nudges us
toward assuming the discourse references one rescue (though it
could also be a past-tense retrospective of general operations).
Qualifying the vet as `i.specialist` rather than the vaguer
`i.experienced` also nudges us toward a singular interpretation.
`p`

`p.
What I am calling a `q.nudge`/, however, is based on situational
models and arguably flows from a conceptual stratum outside
of both semantics and grammar proper; maybe it is even prelinguistic.
Consider

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; \label{itm:pf} People fed the rescued dogs.
`sentenceItem; \label{itm:ve} Vets examined the rescued dogs.
`sentenceList`

There appears to be no explicit principle either in the semantics
of the lexeme `i.to feed`/, or in the relevant tense agreements,
stipulating that the feeding in (\ref{itm:pf})
was prior to the rescue %-- or conversely that
(\ref{itm:ve}) describes events
`i.after` the rescue.  Instead, we interpret the discourse through
a narrative framework that fills in details not provided by
the language artifacts explicitly (that abandoned dogs are
likely to be hungry; that veterinarians treat dogs in clinics, which
dogs have to be physically brought to).  For a similar case-study,
consider the sentences:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; Every singer performed two songs.
`sentenceItem; Everyone performed two songs.
`sentenceItem; Everyone sang along to two songs.
`sentenceItem; Everyone in the audience sang along to two songs.
`sentenceList`

The last of these examples strongly suggests that of potentially
many songs in a concert, exactly two of them were popular and singable
for the audience.  The first sentence, contrariwise, fairly strongly
implies that there were multiple pairs of songs, each pair performed
by a different singer.  The middle two sentences imply either
the first or last reading, respectively (depending on how we
interpret `q.everyone`/).  Technically, the
first two sentences imply a multi-space reading and the latter two
a single-space reading.  But the driving force
behind these implications are the pragmatics of `i.perform` versus
`i.sing along`/: the latter verb is bound more tightly to
its subject, so we hear it less likely that
`i.many` singers are performing `i.one` song pair, or conversely that
every audience member `i.sings along` to one song pair, but
each chooses a `i.different` song pair.
`p`

`p.
The competing interpretations for `i.perform` compared to
`i.sing along`/, and `i.feed` compared to `i.treat`/, are grounded
in lexical differences between the verbs, but I contend
the contrasts are not laid out in lexical specifications
for any of the words, at least so that the implied readings
follow just mechanically, or on logical considerations
alone.  After all, in more exotic but not implausible
scenarios the readings would be reversed:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; The rescued dogs had been treated by vets in the past
(but were subsequently abandoned by their owners).
`sentenceItem; Every singer performed (the last) two songs
(for the grand finale).
`sentenceItem; Everyone in the audience sang along to two songs
(they were randomnly handed lyrics to different songs when
they came in, and we asked them to join in when the song being
performed onstage matched the lyrics they had in hand).
`sentenceList`

In short, it's not as if dictionary entries would specify that
`i.to feed` applies to rescued dogs before they are rescued,
and so forth; these interpretations are driven by narrative
construals narrowly specific to given expressions.  The
appraisals would be very different for other uses of the verbs in
(lexically) similar (but situationally different) cases:
to `q.treat` a wound or a sickness, to `q.perform` a gesture or a
play.  We construct an interpretive scaffolding
for resolving issues like scope-binding and space-building based
on fine-tuned narrative construals that can vary alot
even across small word-sense variance:
As we follow along with these sentences, we have to build a narrative
and situational picture which matches the speaker's intent,
sufficiently well.
`p`

`p.
And that requires prelinguistic background
knowledge which is leveraged and activated (but not mechanically
or logically constructed) by lexical, semantic, or grammatical
rules and forms: `i.rescued dogs` all alone constructs a fairly
detailed mental picture where we can fill in many details by
default, unless something in the discourse tells otherwise
(we can assume such dogs are in need of food, medical care,
shelter, etc., or they would not be describd as
`q.rescued`/).  Likewise `i.sing along` carries a rich mental
picture of a performer and an audience and how they interact, one
which we understand based on having attended concerts rather than
by any rule governing `i.along` as a modifier to `q.sing`
%-- compare the effects of `i.along` in `i.walk along`/,
`i.ride along`/, `i.play along`/, `i.go along`/.  Merely
by understanding how `i.along` modifies `i.walk`/, say
(which is basically straightforward; to
`q.walk along` is basically to `q.walk alongside`/) we
would not automatically generalize to more idiomatic
and metaphorical uses like `q.sing along` or `q.play along`
(as in `i.I was skeptical but I played along (so as not to
start an argument)`/).
`p`

`p.
We have access to a robust collection of `q.mental scripts` which
represent hypothetical scenarios and social milieus where
language plays out.  Language can activate various such
`q.scripts` (and semantic as well as grammatical formations
try to ensure that the `q.right` scripts are selected).
Nonetheless, we can argue that the conceptual and cognitive
substance of the scripts comes not from language per se
but from our overall social and cultural lives.
We are disposed to make linguistic inferences %-- like
the timeframes implied by `i.fed the rescued dogs` or the scopes
implied by `i.sang along to two songs` %-- because of
our enculturated familiarity with events like dog rescues
(and dog rescue organizations) and concerts
(plus places like concert halls).  These concepts are not
produced by the English language, or even by any dialect
thereof (a fluent English speaker from a different
cultural background would not necessarily make the
same inferences %-- and even if we restrict attention to,
say, American speakers, the commonality of disposition
reflects a commonality of the relevant cultural
anchors %-- like dog rescues, and concerts %-- rather than
any homogenizing effects of an `q.American` dialect).
For these reasons, I believe that trying to account for
situational particulars via formal language models alone
is a dead end.  This does not mean that formal language
models are unimportant, only that we need to picture them
resting on a fairly detailed prelinguistic
world-disclosure.
`p`

`p.
There are interesting parallels in this thesis to the role
of phenomenological analysis, and the direct thematization
of issues like attention and intentionality: analyses
which are truly `q.to the things themselves` should take for
granted the extensive subconscious reasoning that undergirds
what we consciously thematize and would be aware of, in terms of
what we deliberately focus on and are conscious of
believing (or not knowing), for a first-personal `expose;.
Phenomenological analysis should not consider itself as
thematizing every small quale, every little patch of
color or haptic/kinasthetic sensation which by some subconscious
process feeds into the logical picture of our surroundings that
props up our conscious perception.  Analogously, linguistic
analysis should not thematize every conceptual and inferential
judgment that guides us when forming the mental, situational
pictures we then consult to set the groundwork for linguistic
understanding proper.
`p`

`p.
These comments apply to both conceptual `q.background knowledge` and
to situational particulars of which we are cognizant in
reference to our immediate surroundings and actions.  This
is the perceptual and operational surrounding that gets
linguistically embodied in deictic reference and other
contextual `q.groundings`/.  Our situational awareness therefore
has both a conceptual aspect %-- while attending a concert,
or dining at a restaurant, say, we exercise cultural background
knowledge to interpret and participate in social events
 %-- and also our phenomenological construal of our locales,
our immediate spatial and physical surroundings.
Phenomenological philosophers have explored in detail how these
two facets of situationality interconnect (David Woodruff Smith and
Ronald McIntyre in `i.Husserl and Intentionality:
A Study of Mind, Meaning, and Language`/, for instance).
Cognitive Linguistics covers similar territory; the `q.cognitive`
in Cognitive Semantics and Cognitive Grammar generally tends
to thematize the conception/perception interface and
how both aspects are merged in situational understanding
and situationally grounded linguistic activity (certainly
more than anything involving Artificial Intelligence or
Computational Models of Mind as are connoted by terms like
`q.Cognitive Computing`/).  Phenomenological and Cognitive
Linguistic analyses of situationality and perceptual/conceptual
cognition (cognition as the mental synthesis of
preception an conceptualization) can certainly enhance and
reinforce each other.
`p`

`p.
But in addition, both point to a cognitive and situational
substratum underpinning both first-person
awareness and linguistic formalization proper %-- in other words,
they point to the thematic limits of
phenomenology and Cognitive Grammar and
the analytic boundary where they give way to
an overarching Cognitive Science.  In the case of
phenomenology, there are cognitive structures that suffuse
consciousness without being directly objects of attention
or intention(ality), just as sensate hyletic experience is
part our consciousness but not, as explicit content,
something we in the general case are conscious `i.of`/.
Analogously, conceptual and situational models
permeate our interpretations of linguistic forms, but
are not presented explicitly `i.through` these
forms: instead, they are solicited obliquely and
particularly.
`p`

`p.
What phenomenology `i.should` explicate is not background situational
cognition but how attention, sensate awareness, and intentionality
structure our orientation `i.`visavis;` this background: how variations
in focus and affective intensity play strategic roles in our engaged
interactions with the world around us.  Awareness is a scale, and
the more conscious we are of a sense-quality, an attentional focus,
or an epistemic attitude, reflects our estimation of the
importance of that explicit content compared to a muted experiential
background.  Hence when we describe consciousness as a stream
of `i.intentional` relations we mean not that the intended
noemata (whether perceived objects or abstract thoughts)
are sole objects of consciousness (even in the moment)
but are that within conscious totality which we are most aware
of, and our choice to direct attention here and there reflcts our
intelligent, proactive interacting with the life-world.
Situational cognition forms the background,
and phenomenology addresses the structure of intentional
and attentional modulations constituting the conscious
foreground.
`p`

`p.
Analogously, the proper role for linguistic
analysis is to represent how multiple layers or strands
of prelinguistic understanding, or `q.scripts`/, or
`q.mental spaces`/, are woven
together by the compositional structures of language.
For instance, `i.The rescued dogs were treated by an experienced vet`
integrates two significantly different narrative frames
(and space-constructions, and so forth): the frame implied
by `q.rescued dogs` is distinct from that implied
by `q.treated by a veterinarian`/.  Note that both spaces are
available for follow-up conversation:


`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; The rescued dogs were treated by an experienced vet.
One needed surgery and one got a blood transfusion.  We went there
yesterday and both looked much better.
`sentenceItem; The rescued dogs were treated by an experienced vet.
One had been struck by a car and needed surgery on his leg.  We
went there yesterday and saw debris from another car crash
%-- it's a dangerous stretch of highway.
`sentenceList`

In the first sentence `q.there` designates the veterinary clinic, while in
the second it designates the rescue site.  Both of these locales are
involved in the original sentence (as locations and also
`q.spaces` with their own environments and configurations:
consider these final three examples).

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; The rescued dogs were treated by an experienced vet.
We saw a lot of other dogs getting medical attention.
`sentenceItem; The rescued dogs were treated by an experienced vet.
It looked very modern, like a human hospital.
`sentenceItem; The rescued dogs were treated by an experienced vet.
We looked around and realized how dangerous that road is %--
for humans as well as dogs.
`sentenceList`

`p`

`p.
What these double space-constructions reveal is that accurate
language understanding does not only require
the proper activated `q.scripts` accompanying words and
phrases, like `q.rescued dogs` and `q.treated by a vet`/.
It also requires the correct integration of each script,
or each mental space, tieing them togther in accord with
speaker intent.  So in the current example we should read that
the dogs `i.could` be taken to the vet `i.because` they were
rescued, and `i.needed` to be taken to the vet `i.because` they
needed to be rescued.  Language structures guide us
toward how we should tie the mental spaces, and the
language segments where they are constructed, together: the
phrase `q.`i.rescued` dogs` becomes the subject of the passive-voice
`i.were treated by a vet`/ causing the two narrative strands of the
sentence to encounter one another, creating a hybrid space
(or perhaps more accurately a patterning between
two spaces with a particular temporal and causal
sequencing; a hybrid narration bridging the spaces).
It is of course this hybrid space, this narrative
recount, which the speaker intends via the sentence.  This
idea is what the sentence is crafted to convey %-- not just
that the dogs were rescued, or that they were taken to a vet, but
that a causal and narrative thread links the two events.
`p`

`p.
I maintain, therefore, that the analyses which are proper to linguistics
%-- highlighting what linguistic reasoning contributes above and beyond
background knowledge and situational cognition %-- should focus on
the `i.integration` of multiple mental `q.scripts`/,
each triggered by different parts and properties of the linguistic
artifact.  The `i.triggers` themselves can be individual words, but
also morphological details (like plurals or tense marking) and
morphological agreement.  On this theory, analysis has two distinct
areas of concerns: identification of grammatical, lexical, and
morphosyntactic features which trigger (assumedly prelinguistic)
interpretive scripts, and reconstructing how these scripts
interoprate (and how language structure determines such integration).
`p`

`p.
In the case of isolating triggers, a wide range of linguistic features
can trigger interpretive reasoning %-- including base lexical choice;
word-senses carry prototypical narrative and situational templates that
guide interpretation of how the word is used in any given context.
`i.Rescued`/, for example, brings on board a network of likely
externalities: that there are rescuers, typically understood to be
benevolent and intending to protect the rescuees from harm; that
the rescuees are in danger prior to the rescue but safe afterward;
that they need the rescuers and could not have reachd safety themselves.
Anyone using the word `q.rescue` anticipates that their addressees will
reason through some such interpretive frame, so the speaker's role is
to fill in the details descriptively or deictically: who are the rescuees
and why they are in danger; who are the rescuers and why they are benevolent
and able to protect the rescuees.  The claim that
the word `i.rescue`/, by virtue of its lexical properties, triggers an
interpretive `q.script`/, is a proposal to the effect that when trying
to faithfully reconstruct speaker intentions
we will try to match the interpretive
frame to the current situation.
`p`

`p.
The `q.script` triggered by word-choice is not just an interpretive
frame in the abstract, but the interpretive `i.process` that matches
the frame to the situation.  This process can be exploited for
metaphorical and figurative effect, broadening the semantic scope
of the underlying lexeme.  In the case of `q.rescue` we have less
literal and more humorous or idiomatic examples like:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; I'm going to rescue her from that boring conversation.
`sentenceItem; The trade rescued a star athlete from a losing team.
`sentenceItem; Your invitation rescued me from studying all night.
`sentenceItem; New mathematical models rescued her original research from obscurity.
`sentenceItem; Discovery of nearby earth-like planets rescued that
star from its reputation as ordinary and boring and revealed that its solar
system may actually be extraordinary.
`sentenceItem; His latest comments rescued him from the perception that
he never says anything controversial.
`sentenceItem; The Soviets rescued thousands of
people from a basically-defeated Germany and sent them to Siberia.
`sentenceList`

Each of these cases subverts the conventional `q.rescue` script by
varying some of the prototypical frame details:  maybe the
`q.danger` faced by the rescuee is actually trivial (as in the
first three), or the rescuee is not a living thing
whose state we'd normally qualify in trms of `q.danger` or `q.safety`/,
or by overturning the benevolence we typically attribute to
rescue events.  In the penultimate sentence someone is described
as rescuing `i.themselves`/, but the effect is ironic: he actually
caused trouble for himself, or so the speaker clearly believes.
And in the final sentence the speaker clearly believes the `q.rescue`
was not needed, that it was not benevolent, and that the `q.rescuees`
ended up worse off: so the choice of word `q.rescue` is clearly
both ironic/sarcastic and implies a mockery of attempts to portray the
rescuers as benevolent.
`p`

`p.
But in these uses subverting the familiar script does not
weaken the lexical merit of the word choice; instead, the interpretive
act of matching the conventional `q.rescue` script to the matter at hand
reveals details and opinions that the speaker wishes to convey.  The
first sentence, for instance, uses `q.rescue` to connote
that being stuck in a boring conversation (and being too polite to drift
away with no excuse) is an unpleasant (even if not life-threatening)
circumstance.  So one part of the frame (that the rescuee needs
outside intervention) holds while the other (that
the rescue is in danger) comes across as excessive but
(by this very hyperbole) communicating speaker sentiment.  By
both invoking the `q.rescue` script and exploiting mismactches between
its template case and the current context, the speaker
conveys both situational facts and personal opinions quite
economically.  Similarly, `i.rescue a paper from obscurity` is
an economical way of saying that research work has been rediscovered
in light of new science; `i.rescued from a bad team` is an economical way
of connoting how an athletic career is less fulfilling on a
poor team, and so forth.
`p`

`p.
All of these interpretive effects %-- both conventional
and unconventional usages %-- stem from the interpretive
scripts bound to words (and triggered by word-choice) at
the underlying lexical level %-- we can assess these by reference
to lexical details alone, setting aside syntactic and morphological
qualities.  Of course, then, a host of further effects
are bound to morphological details when they `i.are` considered.
Case in point are plurals: for each plural usage we have a conceptual
transformation of an underlying singular to a collective, but
how that collective is pictured varies in context.  One
dimension of this variation lies with mass/count: the
mass-plural `i.coffee` (as in `q.some coffee`/) figures the
plurality of coffee (as liquid, or maybe coffee grounds/beans)
in spatial and/or physical/dynamic terms.  So we have:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; There's some coffee on your shirt.
`sentenceItem; There's coffee all over the table.
`sentenceItem; She poured coffee from an ornate beaker.
`sentenceItem; There's too much coffee in the grinder.
`sentenceItem; There's a lot of coffee left in the pot.
`sentenceItem; There's a lot of coffee left in the pot
%-- should I pour it out?
`sentenceList`

These sentences use phrases associated with plurality (`i.all over`/,
`i.a lot`/, `i.too much`/) but with referents that on perceptual and
operational grounds can be treated as singular %-- as in the
appropriate pairing of `i.a lot` and `i.it` in the last sentence.
With count-plurals the collective is figured more as an
aggregate of discrete individuals:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; There are coffees all over the far wall at the expresso bar.
`sentenceItem; She poured coffees from an ornate beaker.
`sentenceItem; There are a lot of coffees left on the table
 %-- shall I pour them out?
`sentenceList`
`p`

`p.
So mass versus count %-- the choice of which plural form to use %--
triggers an interpretation shaping how the plurality is pictured and
conceived (which is itself trigggered by the use of a plural to
begin with).  But if we restrict attention to just, say,
count-plurals, there are still different schemata for intending
collections:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; \label{itm:borough} New Yorkers live in one of five boroughs.
`sentenceItem; New Yorkers reliably vote for Democratic presidential candidates.
`sentenceItem; \label{itm:commute} New Yorkers constantly complain about how long it takes to commute
to New York City.
`sentenceList`

The first sentence is consistent with a reading applied to
`i.all` New Yorkers %-- the five boroughs encompass the whole
extent of New York City.  The second sentence is only reasonable
when applied exclusively to the city's registered voters %-- not all
residents %-- and moreover there is no implication that the
claim applies to all such voters, only a proportion north of one-half.
And the final sentence, while perfectly reasonable, uses `q.New Yorkers`
to name a population completely distinct from the
first sentence %-- only residents from the metro
area, but not the city itself, commute `i.to` the city.
`p`

`p.
These examples demonstrate a point I made earlier, that mapping
singular to plural is not a simple logical operation.  We need
to invoke narrative frames, interpretive scripts, and prelinguistic
background knowledge to understand what `i.sort` of plurality
the speaker intends.  To be sure, the more subtle plurals can
still be read in logical terms, and we can imagine sentences that
hew more crisply to a logical articulation:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; All New York City residents live in one of five boroughs.
`sentenceItem; The majority of New York voters support Democratic
presidential candidates.
`sentenceItem; Many New York metro area residents complain about how
long it takes to commute to New York City.
`sentenceList`

According to truth-theoretic semantics, sentences compel addressees to believe
(or at least consider) logically structured propositions `i.by virtue of`
linguistic shape replicating the architecture of the intended propositional
complexes, as these would be represented in first-order logic.  This
view on linguistic meaning is consistent with the last three sentences,
which are designed to map readily to logical notations (signaled by
quasimathematical phrases like `i.the majority of`/).  But most sentences
do not betray their logical form so readily: these latter sentences actually
sound less fluent, more artificial, than their prior equivalents.
`p`

`p.
It is also true that the more `q.logical` versions are more, we might say,
dialectically generalized because they do not assume the same level
of background knowledge.  Someone who knew little about
New York geography could probably make sense of the latter
sentences but might misinterpret, or at least have to consciously
think over, the former ones.  So we may grant that exceptionally
logically-constructed sentences can be clearer for a broad
audience, less subject to potential confusion, and indeed such
logically cautious language is a normal stylistic feature of
technical, legal, and journalistic discourse.  But for this reason
such discourse comes across as self-consciously removed from
day-to-day language.  As I argued from multiple angles earlier,
in the typical case %-- i.e., stylistically
neutral, day-to-day language %-- syntactic
composition does not neatly recapitulate logical form.
`p`

`p.
My prior analysis demonstrated warrants for this idea by
highlighting narrative and imagistic aspects
of language used to convey ideas, like `q.come out against`
providing the verb-phrases in reports of people
criticizing something.  Here, examples like
(\ref{itm:borough})-(\ref{itm:commute}) point to a similar
conclusion, but from a more lexico-semantic orientation:
words like `i.borough` and `i.commute` carry a space
of logical details that tend to force logical
interpretations one way or another
(e.g., the detail that the territory of a city
is fully partitioned by boroughs, `i.so`/, it
is `i.all` citizens who live in a borough).  This part of the
logic is however not reflected in sentence-structure; it is,
rather, latent
in lexical norms and assumed part of understanding
relevant sentences only because linguistic
competence is understood to include
familiarity with the logical
implications of the lexicalized concepts:
e.g. that the quantification in `q.New Yorkers
live in one of five boroughs` is `i.all`/,
but the quantification in `q.New Yorkers
vote democratic` is `i.most`/.
`p`

`p.
Here I'll also add the
following: the current examples show
how if addressees `i.have` the requisite background knowledge,
linguistic structure does not have to replicate logical structure very
closely to be understood.  The content which addressees undrstand may
have a logical form, and language evokes this form %-- guides
addressees toward considering specific propositional content %-- but
this does not happen because linguistic structure in any precise way mimics,
replicates, reconstructs, or is otherwise organized propositionally.  Instead,
the relation of language to predicate structures is evidently
oblique and indirect: language triggers interpretive processes
which guide us toward propositional content, but the structure
of language is shaped around fine-tuning the activation of
this background cognitive dynamics more than around any need to model
predicate organization architecturally.   In the case of plurals,
the appearance of plural forms like `i.New Yorkers` or `i.coffees`
compels us to find a reasonable cognitive model for the
signified multitude, and this model will have a logical form
%-- but the linguistic structures themselves do not in general
model this form for us, except to the limited degree needed to
activate prelinguistic interpretive thought-processes.
`p`

`p.
I make this point in terms of plural `i.forms`/, and earlier made
similar claims in terms of lexical details.  A third group of triggers I
outlined involved morphosyntactic `i.agreement`/, which establishes
inter-word connections which themselves trigger interpretive processing.
Continuing the topic of plurals, how words agree with other words
in singular or plural forms evokes schema which guide situational
interpretations.  So for instance:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; My favorite band gave a free concert last night.
They played some new songs.
`sentenceItem; There was some pizza earlier, but it's all gone.

`sentenceList`

Plurality here is introduced not only by isolated morphology (like `i.slices`/,
`i.players`/, `i.songs`/), but via agreements marked by
word-forms in syntactically significant pairings: was/were, it/they,
there is/there are.  Framing all of these cases is how we can usually schematize
collections both plurally and singularly: the same set can be cognized as a
collection of discrete individuals one moment and as an integral whole the next.
This allows language some flexibility when designating plurals
(as extensively analyzed by Ronald Langacker: see his discussion of examples
like `i.Three times, students asked an interesting question`/).  A sentence
discussing `i.slices of pizza` can schematically shift to treating
the pizza as a mass aggregate in `i.it's all gone`/.  Here the antecedent
of `i.it` is `i.slices` (of pizza).  In the opposite direction, the mass-plural
`q.toast` can be refigured as a set of individual pieces in `i.they're all gone`/.
The single `i.band` becomes the group of musicians in the band.
In short, how agreements are executed invites the addressee to reconstruct
the speaker's conceptualization of different referents discussed by
a sentence, at different parts of the sentence: linking
`i.it` to `i.slices` or `i.cohort`/, or `i.they` to `i.the band` or
`i.the toast`/, evokes a conceptual interpretation shaped in
part by how morphosyntactic agreement overlaps with `q.semantic`
agreement.  Matching `i.they` to `i.the band` presents agreement
in terms of how we conceive the aggregate (as a collection of
musicians); using `q.it` would also present an agreement, but
one schematizing other aspect of the band conecpt.
`p`

`p.
In the last five above cases, `i.it` similarly binds (being singular) to
`i.the franchise` seen as a single unit %-- here basic grammar and
conceptual schema coincide %-- but `i.it` also binds
to the `i.core of young players`/.  The
players on a team can be figured as a unit or a multiple.  The franchise itself
can be treated as a multiple (the various team executives and decision-makers),
as in `i.they failed to surround the stars with enough depth`/.  The last sentence
is ambiguous between both readings: `q.they` could designate either the players
or the franchise.  Which reading we hear alters the sense of `q.have`/: asserting
that the star `i.players` lack enough depth implies that they cannot execute
plays during the game as effectively as with better supporting players;
asserting that the `i.franchise` lacks depth makes the subtly different point
that there is not enough talent over all.  The variant which would include
`q.around them` nudges toward the second reading; but it is
still permissible to, according to speaker intent, parse the last
`i.they` as designating the `i.franchise` and the last `i.them` as
the `i.players` %-- i.e., that final `i.they`//`i.them` pair
having different antecedents.
`p`

`p.
The unifying theme across these cases is that when forming sentences we often
have a choice of how we figure plurality, and moreover these choices can be
expressed not only in individual word-forms but in patterns of agreement.
Choosing to pronominalize `i.slices of pizza` or `i.cohort of players`
as `i.it`/, or alternatively `i.they`/, draws attention to either the more
singular or more multitudinal aspects of the aggregate in question.
But this effect is not localized to the individual
`i.it`//`i.they` choice; it depends on
tracing the pronoun to its antecedent and construing
how the antecedent referent has both individuating and
multiplicity-like aspects.
Thus both individuation and plurality are latent in phrases like
`i.slices of` or `i.cohort of`/, and this singular/plural co-conceiving
is antecedently figured by how subsequent morphosyntax agrees
with the singular or, alternatively, the plural.
`p`

`p.
Moreover, these patterns of agreement invoke new layers of
interpretation to identify the proper conceptual scope of plurals.
In `i.The band planned a tour, where they debuted new songs` we hear
the scope of `q.they` as narrower than its antecedent `q.the band`/,
because only the band's `i.musicians` (not stage crew, managers, etc.)
typically actually perform:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; The band planned a tour, where
they debuted new songs.
`sentenceItem; \label{itm:teamflew} The team flew to
New York and they played the Yankees.
`sentenceItem; \label{itm:theflies} The city's largest theater company
will perform `q.The Flies`/.
`sentenceList`

Likewise in (\ref{itm:teamflew}), only the athletes are referenced via
`i.they played`/; but presumably many other people (trainers, coaches, staff)
are encompassd by `q.the team flew`/.  And in (\ref{itm:theflies})
we do not imply that the Board of Directors will
actually take the stage (the President
as Zeus, say).  Even in the course of one sentence, plurals
are reinterpreted and redirected:

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; The city's largest theater company
performed `q.The Flies` in French, but everyone's accent
sounded Quebecois.
`sentenceItem; The city's largest theater company
performed `q.The Flies`/; then they invited a professor
to discuss Sartre's philosophy when the play was over.
`sentenceList`

In the first sentence, the `q.space` built by the sentence is wider
initially but narrows to encompass only the actual actors on stage.
In the second, the `q.space` narrows in a different direction, since
we hear a programming decision like pairing a performance with a
lecture as made by a theater's administrators rather than its actors.
I discussed similar modulation in conceptual schemas related to plurality
and pluralization earlier; what is distinct in these last examples is how
the interpretive processes for cognizing plurality are shaped by
agreement-patterns (like `i.it` or `i.they` to a
composite antecedent) as
much as by lexical choice, or morphology, in isolation.
`p`

`p.
I have accordingly outlined a theory where lexical, morphological, and
morphosyntactic layers all introduce `q.triggers` for cognitive processes,
and it is these procsses which (via substantially prelinguistic perception
and conceptualization) ultimately deliver linguistic meaning.  What is
`i.linguistic` about these phenomena is how specifically linguistic
formations %-- word choice, word forms, inter-word agreements in form %--
trigger these (in no small measure pre- or extra-linguistic) interpretations.
But as I suggested this account is only preliminary to analysis of
how multiple interpretive processes are `i.integrated`/.  Linguistic
`i.structure` contributes the arrangements through which the
crossing and intersecting between interpretive
`q.scripts` are orchestrated.  Hence at the higher linguistic scales and
levels of complexity, the substance of linguistic research, on this view,
should gravitate toward structural intgration of interpretive
processes, even more than individual interpretive triggers themslves.
`p`

`p.
This higher scale is my focus in the next section %-- seen from the
perspective of formal and computational models as well as
everyday language use.
