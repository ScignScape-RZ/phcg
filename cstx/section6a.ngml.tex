\spsubsectiontwoline{Phenomenology and the Limits of Logic-Compositionality}
\p{The perpetuation of 20th-century philosophical tropes
\mdash{} Analytic vs. Continental Philosophy; humanities vs.
logicao-mathematics \mdash{} perhaps diagnoss something incomplete in
20th century thought that the 21st century needs to transcend, but
it also bears witness to intellectual structures that directly
abut phenomenology itself.  The idea, for example, that
logico-mathematical analysis is distinct from cultural-humanities
theory \mdash{} that works of art, for example, do not have logical
or mathematical forms; that the structures evinced by cultural
and artistic productions (and any system of signs and communication
necessarily has \i{some} rigorous structure) does not itself
have a logical and mathematical dimension, or a structural
form that if specified in isolation from its signifying context
would reveal logical and/or mathematical properties.  A parallel
assumption is that logical and mathematical structures need to be
expressed \mdash{}and indeed \i{located} \mdash{} via a few canonical
theories, such as first-order predicate logic, first-order
quantification, and (perhaps modally inflected) set theory.
So 20th-century Analytic Philosophy unfolded in a
kind of semi-explicit dialog with disciplines such as
linguistics and computer science which promoted, from the
full spectrum of mathematical domains, a handful of
specific paradigms \mdash{} like Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory,
Tarskian quantificational-predicate logic, and
Hindley-Milner type theory \mdash{} that in turn became equally
paradigmatic in fields like formal language analysis and
\q{knowledge enginering}.  This is not to imply that
linguists and computer scientists took their marching orders
from philsophers \mdash{} it's probably equally true that Analytic
Philosphers gravitated to these kinds of mathematical frameworks
because they were proving empircally useful in other fields.
But we can say that a group of disciplines aiming to
technically examine subjects at the intersection between
human thought and formal systems \mdash{} language, knowledge,
valid inference, Artificial Intelligence \mdash{} collectively
progressed toward a vision of what logicomathematical
structure \i{is}, a paradigm (or network of paradigms)
which undergirds any reception of phenomenology insofar
as a \q{Naturalizing Phenomenology} project seeks to
initiate dialog and comparisons between how phenomenology
and Analytic Philosophy, respectively, treat logic,
mathematics, or formal-systematic explanations in general.
}
\p{Interestingly, the logico-mathematical formulations that
arguably have come to dominate methodology on the scholarly
\i{frontier} between science and humanities \mdash{} lingustics,
cognitive science, computer science \mdash{} are different from
those that seem to dominate mathematics and physical sciences
themselves.  Of course, some logical form is intrinsic to
any formal method since formal systems cannot be blatantly
self-contradictory.  But the vehicles by which criteria
of logical consistency are expressed in, say,
linguistics and philosophy \mdash{} presenting sentence-meaning via
first-order logical glosses of their predicate
(locutionary, assertorial) semantics, for instance, or
equating meanings to the conditions in the world
(or possible worlds) that would make linguistic expressions true
\mdash{} these first-order and set-theoretic intuitions do not
necessarily coincide with working mathematicians' visualization of
the spaces where their own axioms and formulae are in force.
Category theory, for example, recognizes that set and predicate logic
are in a sense emergent properties of the different formal domains
where mathematics is enacted \mdash{} sheaves, topoi, manifolds, sites, and
so on \mdash{} which are not isomorphic, propagating to variation
in how logic itself is understood.  Insofar as there is no single
formalization to specify what a \i{predicate} is, or a \i{set},
we are on shakier foundation if we want to apply these notions to
conceptual or linguistic investigations \mdash{} to consolidate the concept
\q{cat}, say, as the set of all \i{felix catus}, or
the meaning of \i{Hugo is sleeping on the sofa} as a particular state
of affairs pertaining wherein a certain tabby cat sleeps on a
certain piece of furniture.  The problem with this
sort of logico-mathematical gloss is that it either employs sets and
predicates in an informal manner \mdash{} which brings us back to
the circularity problems I analyzed earlier, since
an honest assertion that Hugo is sleeping on the sofa obvious
intends to report, modulo the imperfections of informal logic,
that as a point of fact Hugo is sleeping on the sofa \mdash{} or
it tries to elevate the logic from informal to formal,
which legitimately then adds explanatory value to our technical
grasp of the sentence, but then we get tangled in questions like
what sets are.
}
\p{To put it differently, it certainly seems as if the
sentence \q{Hugo is sleeping on the sofa}, as an intended and
sensed artifact in a human world, in some fashion encapsulates and
\i{designates} a proposition, and/or the state of affairs, that this
tabby cat is in repose on that piece of furniture.  The sentence
(deliberately produced sound patterns, perhaps) provides us
with mental access or handle to that proposition, making it an
unitary and isolated object of thought, as well as a thought that
can be shared between people via language.  There is a predicate
there that seems to be \i{intended} in the phenomenological sense
by the sentence as a linguistic gestalt, just as Hugo is intended
in our visual consciousness when we eplicitly see him on the couch,
or at least analogous to that regime of intentionality
insofst as Husserl finds both parallels and contrasts between
\i{apophantic} and preceptual-integrative analysis.
That is, the predicate or fact of Hugo's sleeping at that spot
is the noema to the sentence's phenomena, just as Hugo is the
noema to our seeing-Hugo.  In this sense it is non-circular to
proceed with \q{Hugo is sleeping on the sofa} to mean the
fact of Hugo's sleeping on the sofa, since we are exploiting the
seemingly reundant repetition of the sentence to designate
indirectly a predicate which we have no way of expressing except
through the sentence.  So there is \i{something} there that seems to
have a logical form we need (at least if our goal is theoretical
completeness) to cast light on.
}
\p{But when we then pass from informal to formal logic
we encounter the gap separating mathematics circa 2019 from
mathematics circa 1919.  Hugo, for example, is a cat,
which (in the precincts of informal logic, i.e. a logic
solid enough to shape communication and coordinations of
thought but backgrounded as only one of many structural
parameters delimiting how thoughts and the world avolves)
means that Hugo is a member of the set of all cats.  But
what is a set?  Garfield (a fictional, comic-strip cat)
is also a cat but he does not \q{exist}, so the set of all cats
cannot be enumerated just by (even as a mental exercise) pointing
to them one-by-one.  Moreover, what is referenced by the word
or idea \q{Hugo} in the thought that Hugo belongs to the set of
cats?  We can look at and point to Hugo to get a rough idea; but
the fur Hugo just shed is not a member of the set of cats, even
though it is (or was) a part of Hugo.  It is by no means
obvious that we can, even as another mental exercise, define
\q{Hugo} by an enumeration (metaphysically possible even
if logistically infeasible) of hairs, or cells or molecules, that
via mereological summation grounds the name in a
logically well-established referential framework.
}
\p{On course, it is possible to logically restate a sentence like
\q{Hugo, who is a cat, sleeps on the couch} in first-order logic,
which seems to be arriving at a formal exposition of the predicate
informally intended by the sentence \mdash{} the noema to the
sentence's phenomena.  But formal machinery
only papers over the logical incompleteness of concepts like
\q{set} and \q{predicate}: a logical denotation of the sentence
\i{seems} to refer to the state of affairs that the sentence
tokens (and not just the sentence itself) via quantifier
symbols and other logic artifacts.  I'd argue, however, that these
elements are meta-discursive cues rather than theoretical posits:
they invite us to entertain the thought of the predicate lurking
beyond the sentence via a departure from discursive norms,
the same way that simply repeating the sentence does.  In short,
it may be non-circular to gloss \q{Hugo, who is a cat,
sleeps on the couch} via formations like \ExistsX{} and the
logical form gets us closer to apprehending the abstract predicate,
but this is not because of logical symbols like \q{\Exists{}}
in themselves, but because of their rhetorical effects as
interrupting the flow of conventional philosophical writing.
Symbols of quantification, set membership, or part/whole
inclusion only carry the imprimateur of logical rigor
insofar as we can synchronize what flavor of mathematics
we are using with which to theorize quantification or parthood.
}
\p{We can, for example, argue that Hugo is an extended
three-dimensional thing (or maybe a four-dimensional
perdurant, since he's still here day after day), and
any reasonably compact and continuous \ndim{} manifold can
potentially be designated in thought and language.  This is
reasonable, but it positions our infrastructure for the semantics
of proper names (and a large class of referring expressions)
against a topological backdrop in which we can talk about sets
of points, or perhaps regions spanned by extremum points
(Hugo's fur as the convex hull of Hugo's solid mass) or just
reasons as first-class posits in a point-free algebraic
topology.  We can then present a case for the semantics of
\q{Hugo} as a conventionalized sound adopted by a small group
of humans to designate a particular four-dimensional manifold
\mdash{} at least if we have a sufficient topological or Categorical
foundation to give logical exactitude to concepts like
\q{four-dimensional manifold}.  This still neglects
merological problems, like Hugo losing some fur
but still being himself; either the manifold Hugo
is scattered wherever his fur (and, well, peepee and poopie)
are or the Hugo manifold has fragmented into lots of disjoint
other manifolds, only one of which is \q{Hugo}.  This latter
option suggests that we need to identify the \q{essential parts}
of Hugo, not the inessential parts like those in the litter box;
then the Hugo manifold is the one that contains those parts
\mdash{} i.e. we need a mereological formalization to embed in
the topological one.
}
\p{It is certainly possible that by patching philosophical incompletions
and importing mathematical vocabularies we can piece together a
reasonably compelling theory of mereological/topological
complexes, maybe with graded sets (some parts are more essential than
others), to logically model the semantics of singular referents.
By taking sets of such complexes, maybe
with a modal machinery (for, say, fictional cats) or
graded membership (some things are only partially
subsumed by their concept: is a pet malawolf a dog?) we can
similarly flesh out a set-theoretic semantics, and combining
the singular and set analyses perhaps achieve a logically
inflected semantics applicable to a broad class of linguistic events.
But have we therefore truly surpassed informal logic,
coiled within dialogic conventions, toward a rigorous
theory of linguistic meanings via formal logic?  Do we need
topology, mereology, graded sets, and modal logic because these
are intrinsic to the epistemic domain where signification
happens, or are we just grabbing an assortment of mathematical
tools to plug the leaks in a philosophical attitude wherein
there is a relatively straightforward formalization of
quantifier-predicate logic that can polish the informal
logic of language, but which perhaps failed to
anticipate the mathematical complexities of formalizing what
exactly are the \q{thises} that quantifiers can quantify over?
}
\p{These questions are directly relevant to phenomenology \mdash{}
and to Analytic Philosophy's reception of and dialog with
phenomenology \mdash{} because a phenomenological account of
issues like manifold synthesis and mereological essentialism
can easily bring forward formulations that overlap
with a \q{logistic} paradigm in some details but not others,
and profitably pursuing the dialog depends on identifying both
similarities and differences.  The story of Hugo as a
four-dimensional manifold might not be told in a phenomenological
context, but we might study our visual episodes involving Hugo
in terms of perceptual synthesis: seeing Hugo from the front
we anticipate that we \i{could} see Hugo's tail if we were
standing behind him and it was not as much tucked beneath him;
this anticipation is also a formula for how we integrate
successive impressions as our gaze travels from his ears to
his tail that we see partially.  There is a certain continuity and
topography of our accumulation of successive visuals that
retraces a sort of manifold, even if now we're talking
not about Hugo (or his body) himself but rather the
interplay between the space where he's laying and my own
perspctive and vantage.  So, even
on a phenomenological basis we encounter fragments of analysis
that point toward something like a mathematical treatment \mdash{}
but that doesn't mean we are necessarily committed to a
quantitative-predicate logical theory of preception, or
equally important, of the communicative acts that
perception yields.
}
\p{In pursuit of logical rigor, 20th-century Analytic Philosophy
(plus, say, linguistics, cognitive science, and fields related
to knowledge engineering and information technology, like
AI-driven medical diagnosis) have highlighted
specific logico-mathematical representation-regimes,
building up a paradigm of logicality (as a philosophical
quality, something one senses in analytic methods)
and propositionality (as a corresponding analyzand).
The various layers of this construction address different
aspects of logic, or \q{logicality} as such, such as
predication (that which can be qualified as true or
false in the first place), quantification (establishing
a scope for empirical truthness, so logic does not not decay
into tautology \mdash{} that \i{one} thing or \i{some}
members of set have a property where others don't, modeling
contingency and a posteriority), modality
(capturing the further contingency that most facts
could have been otherwise), mereology and individuation,
quantification scope, supervenience, and other logical
themes that seem intrinsic to any intellectual territory
where predication and true-falseness pertains.
Codification of these facets of logic not only
fine-tunes philosophical analysis; it also provides a
semantics for natural language insofar as we accept that
meaning is centered on locutionary truth-conditions (from
which phenomena like illocutionary force and polarity
\mdash{} our feelings and pragmatic intentions \visavis{}
states of affairs at the predicate substrate of language \mdash{}
can be reached in supplemental analysis) and a philosophical
basis for the formal/computational representation of facts
and knowledge (such as, in database design).  So
insofar as a philosophical-computational-linguistic consensus
emerged on the broad outlines of what logic entails,
this paradigm spread into multiple disciplines,
scientific as well as humanistic, and applied as well
as purely speculative.  Insofar as Naturalizing Phenomenology
involves dialog with Analytic Philosophy, it
intersections with these different faces of logicality and
the mathematical systems which prior generations believed best
captured them.
}
\p{But this does not mean phenomenology needs to endorse the full
stack of paradigms layered in Analytic Philosophy's
excavation of logic; that we need to approach logical-mathematical
eidetics via quantifier-predicate logic, for example, or to
prefer the mathematical frameworks through which
quantification and predication are usually modeled.
Mathematics itself pulls in different directions: quantification,
precication, and set-membership have different
theories in different contexts, e.g. mereotopology compared to
algebraic topology compared to Category theory.  These
lines of development are largely tangential to Analytic
Philosophy partly because the philosophical (and, say,
cognitive-scientific) push toward formalized logic is not really
a push toward \i{mathematics}, but rather a vision of
bringing rigor to what is still essentially \i{informal} logic.
That is, pursuing for instance a formal treatment of
quantification to undergird natural language semantics
does not mean building up to a rigorous, maybe
Categorial theory of quantification in terms
of (say) dependent coproducts, because what \q{logicality}
does in language does not depend on that degree of technical
detail.  But that means in effect that operationalizing
the \q{logicalness} of language is not so much a problem
in \i{formal} (mathematical) logic but a formalized
\i{informal} logic, logico-linguistic or logico-mental
(as in \q{folk theory of other minds}) more than
logico-mathematical.  Fair enough; but this then places other
analytic conveniences (like referents as 4-dimensional
manifolds) on shakier ground, because we're no longer
in an all-encompassing logico-\i{mathematical} paradigm.
Topology and Category Theory, in effect, reveals the difference
between formal-mathematical and formalized-informal logic.
Trying to negotiate with mathematics as source of methodological
rigor, mathematics proves to be an elusive partner.
