`p.
Note that `i.buttered` in `i.buttered toast` is in the current
examples not essential; the sentences
without this qualification are similar
in meaning to the sentences with it.  This suggests that if the
adjectives designate (or solicit) cognitive processes that
build upon some other (logically) prior process, the anterior
process can also suffice on its own, at least in the context of
these example sentences.
