For such reasons, I will conclude this paper with
a focus on Link Grammar and on how the Link Grammar
perspective relates to the phenomenological and
cognitive-grammar positions and case studies I
outlined in earlier studies.  Further extensions to
Directed Hypergraphs and the technical foundations
of multidimensional `q.procedural` type theories
defined on Directed Hypergraphs %-- which thematically
complement Link Grammar to the degree that Link Grammar
and Directed Hypergraphs are naturally paired up as
in OpenCog %-- are beyond the scope of
this paper (though I have presented some form
of this anlysis in other publications).
