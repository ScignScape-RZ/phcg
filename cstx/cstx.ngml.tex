\begin{document}\title{Cognitive State Semantics and the 
Interface Theory of Meaning}
\maketitle{}
\begin{abstract}\noindent Start with the question of conditions of possibility for 
language to exist: how spoken, written, or inscribed signs 
differ from other kinds of things, enough to establish language as 
something that exists in the world.  Language is a regime of 
multiple conversation partners, an ambient surrounding where they 
share actions, perceptions, and foci of attention, and a common posit of structured rules.  
If communication is successful, each sign's referent is 
isolated, collectively/phenomenologically, from a (canonically spatiotemporal) reality 
that extends beyond it.  My goal here is to sketch this process 
with the help of formal and Computational linguistic theories, 
but keeping in sight a cognitive nuance and intersubjectivity that is 
(thankfully) an essential, unavoidable part of human language.
I will incorporate technical models mostly from Link Grammar 
and Type-Theoretic Semantics, understanding the latter as possibly 
layering on the former to complete a syntax/semantic pairing.  
I propose both cases for and limits on formal theories' 
applicability for Cognitive Linguistics/Humanities/Phenomenology, through the lens of the 
Philosophy of Science \mdash{} 
arguing how Phenomenology and Cognitive Linguistics, while distinct traditions, can work powerfully in consort.
