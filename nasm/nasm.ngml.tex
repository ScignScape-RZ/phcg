\begin{quote}Now, the \q{science of salience}
proposed by Petitot and Smith (1997) illustrates the
kind of formalized analysis made possible through the direct
mathematization of phenomenological descriptions.
Its aim is to account for the invariant descriptive
structures of lived experience (what Husserl called \q{essences})
through formalization, providing a descriptive geometry of
macroscopic phenomena, a \q{morphological eidetics} of the
disclosure of objects in conscious experience (in Husserl's
words, the \q{constitution} of objects).
Petitot employs differential geometry and morphodynamics
to model phenomenal experience, and Smith uses formal structures from
mereotopology (the theory of parts, wholes, and their boundaries)
to a similar effect.
